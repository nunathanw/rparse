"[3&&Imalittleanonyme&&POST=IATA for not wating to talk to my cousin anymore ?] I (20m) had a girlfriend (18f) wich we are gonna call Helie and a male cousin (19m) wich we are gonna call Nathan. For the context I met my girlfriend at a camp 2 years ago, after 4 month of talking I asked her to be my girlfriend when we were on the 3rd date, after that it was lovely. She's the first one who actually made me feel loved, she was always making sure that I was happy, we often hung out. This year we got again to the camp where we met but she was staying with her grandparents, and I was staying with my family camping, eating mashmallows etc... It's at this time it started to be really confusing between each other but I knew why, It's because there was my cousin, Nathan and by the passed Helie and my cousin had a relashionship for only 1 week, a ""holyday relashion"" he called it. They were very weird around each other so I made sure to pass time with my cousin, but pass time with Helie too, just the two of us, she was very happy. Then after 2 weeks I got to go in another part of my family for a birthday, so I took off, my cousin too, but Helie stayed at her grandparents house. A week after I was gone, I learned that my cousin was going back at the camp. Just so you know I had a really good trust in Helie, but I was not feeling my cousin. There was a party at the camping where we were staying, my girlfriend said to me that she was going there with a friend, and that she will stay with some more friends that I knew. But there was my cousin in those friend too, I was a little scared but I trusted her so I didn't say a thing. The problem is that the next day, Helie was cold, she didn't say if she got back home safe, she sended me a pic where I could see beers, packs of cigarettes (just so you know she wasn't drinking or smoking when I knew her) that's why I asked her what was going on with the pic, and she was honest, she told me that she had a few beers and that she smocked on a electronic cigarette. That's when I realised only my cousin had one in the whole group. I called her twice and she didn't respond but I had a bad feeling about what could have happened, and I was right. I called my cousin since Helie wasn't responding and he responded, but with a weird voice, just like he got up even if it was 4pm, I asked him if he knew where Helie, he told me that she was at her grandparents house, they helped her go home after she drank and couldn't go home by herself but he said ""I'm sorry"" I asked him ""about what ?"" he responded ""oh she didn't tell you ?"" ""Tell me what Nathan ?"" ""Well I'm sorry, I wasn't myself and I kissed her, she kissed me back and we slept together and I took her back home when we got up this morning because she wasn't feeling very well, I'm so sorry bro I never meant to do it but it was so tempting"" When I heard those words, I was shacking, I wanted to cry, my whole world just destroyed because of some beers and a party. I didn't say a thing, I ended up the call, I called Helie again and she responded, I asked if she had something to say to me, I heard her voice cracking and that's when she told me everything, she was crying, begging for pardon, saying that she was drunk and it was a mistake.. I was at my aunt house sitting on a chair outside listening, waiting, crying... She asked if I was there I told her ""yes, but from now on, i'll never be here anymore"" and I ended up the call. It's been 2 month now, she tried calling a few times but I blocked her, my cousin sended me tons of messages asking if we could have a discussion, men to men, I told him that he wasn't one, not anymore, he started using words I can't say here because he was attacking my dead uncle(his father) saying ""I swear on the grave of my father"" and other horrible things like that, I told him to stop texting me, that he was just a stranger now. I told my parents about it and why they'll never gonna see Helie anymore, they were disgusted and told my cousin to fuck off and never come near me again. I got news from a friend of mine, Helie and my cousin are now a couple and they are posting pictures of them kissing with a lot of big texts saying how grateful they are to be with each other, I'm just disgusted. My cousin told his mom what happened and she protected him, saying that I was a child even tho I'm an adult for reacting like that, my mom told her to fuck off and that it was the fault of her child for being such a brat and not knowing how to control himself. Now this is why I'm posting this story, reddit, is my aunt right ? Am I the asshole for not wanting to talk to my cousin anymore ?",[1&&Sativa1983&& Definitely not an ah.

What happened hurts a lot and you need time and space to heal. They (Helie, cousin and aunt) have to leave you alone for awhile, until you feel better and until you feel okay to move on. Everyone heals differently, at a different pace, and they have to respect that. Maybe your mom can give them the message, because staying in contact with any of them sets you back and re-opens the wound. Protect yourself. It gets better. ]"
"[0&&Flower_power2828&&POST=AITA for leaving my boyfriend when I found out that at the beginning he liked someone else?] Me (20f) and my boyfriend (25m) had in 2022 a relationship for 1.5 year. We met by a party, the party was from my girl bestfrie nd. And that was for him his niece. Let’s name the girl x, x had her 16’s birthday party,and had here sweet 16 party, I was 18 years old. X parents were rly rich. So the party was big, with much w!ne… I had much w!ne. And was rly drunk. So I couldn’t drive anymore my self to home. And then. My bestfriend said to me that a guy, was going to ride me home. So there was I, in a car. With a complete stranger, and what was that “stranger” hot. We were home, and he said that he liked my personality ( okay, I was drunk so idk how he liked my “ personality”) but I gave him my telephone number. So 4 months later. We got into dating for a month. I rly liked him. And I thought he did so to. We texted much, and got rly close to! We are now 5 months away, and i was SO in love with him. So I asked if he wanted to begin a relationship. And he said yes! I thought I found my husband! But then it was 1 and a half year later after we met at the party. We became closer and closer, I met his family, his adorable lil sis!I had such a good relationship with his family! I thought we didn’t got any private things from each other. So I asked him one day to do a trend from TikTok, a phone switch. But .. he didn’t liked that idea at all. We got also in a fight! Bcs I didn’t find it such a problem. And then one day. I thought abt that fight, he was away. And his phone was on the table. I grabbed his phone and checked it. DATUM:1 year ago. Texted with * ….❤️* ……. ME: “hey beutifal, you know who I am? The one from work where you flirted with 😘” ….❤️: “ oh hey! What do u want? Btw that just was a joke!” ME: “ do u want to go to a date with me? U are rly beutifal yk?” …. ❤️: “ I’m sorry no, I don’t like boys. I’m gay… I didn’t tell you. My humor is just flirty humor yk! But thanks for the compliment!” ……. And then , when he came home. I said I saw everything he said at the beginning of the relationship. We got in fight. I got rly angry. I slapped him in the face… And I said goodbye… We where then by my house. I screamed angry that he has to go, he was gone, and I was alone. Again. I AM THE ASSHOLE? OR IS HE THE ASSHOLE? DISCLAIMER!: this is my story, but it’s all a fake situation. I maked it up! But it is fake, but if it was real. Would I be the asshole? Say it in the comment!","[5&&bottlehopper&& You would be the asshole. If they are no longer communicating, you have nothing to worry about.

"[5&&angler88&&POST=IATA for being angry with my GF after she completely misbehaves when drunk?] I (m33) have been with my girlfriend (33) for 2 years. We love each other and I never loved anyone so much. we fight from time to time- nothing dramatic. I consider myself very caring partner, I do everything I can for her comfort all the tine. We both love partying and going to 2 multiday camping music festivals with our friends during each summer. With that also comes having some drinks to get into mood. I am repeating- this happens twice a year so before jumping to conclusions please bear in mind that this is not very regular happening. When we are in those festivals with our friends, I can bear a lot and I usually drink as much as needed so that I am in a good mood- or even if i drink a bit more, i always behave and I am only nicer than usual when drunk. Good vibes only. My GF is a completely different story. We have gone to 4 festivals together (2 summers) and she completely fucked them ALL up, because: she does not know her limits obviously and once a festival she drinks way more than she should have.. and then hell begins. She starts to blame me for losing her (when she goes to the toilet) , she is disoriented, she calls me 20 times in a row and calls me names. What I try to do in thise situations is I try to be calm and find her asap. But she is so wasted she cannot even define where she is so usually I search for her for an hour or more. And in the meantime she calls me on my phone all the time, blames me for being a dick, that I do not care etc etc….she can be very vulgar in these situations. This lasts until i finally find her, then she is hysteric, calls me names again and she hysterically cries. She even tells me she breaks up with me because she cannot bear this anymore. However, things she is saying do not make much sense becasue she is wasted. She is completely toxic to me in those situations and I feel desperate because I have done nothing wrong at all. So I am just listening to her invectives and dramas and all the drunk bullshit that has nothing in common with sober reality… then i somehow (peacefully) manage to drag her into our tent, and slowly put her on matress and wait until she falls asleep. In the morning she just doesnt remeber a thing. She just remebers we fought, but has no clue at all about what. When I tell her the story, she is very sorry and says she did not mean it… and she has no idea why she has done it, she again starts to cry and I can see she is very frustrated about what she has dobe. But at that time I am already usually very repulsedbecause of what I had to go throuhh last nigt so i am cold to her …. And then the whole festival I have that situation before my eyes and it makes me sad …. My good times with friends at festival are simply marked with this psycho event. AITA for being cold? She says that I carry this situations with me long time after they happen and she can feel that I am not “same old me” maybe even for a month after such a situation. And that is true, I am fighting inside. I am fighting to reopen again and i fight inside me so that I find forgiveness. But its hard But tbh, I am not sure I can take 1 more situation like that in my life. It completely repulses me and I feel that there is no place for such dramas in my life. She promised she wont do it anymore, but i am bit skeptical.- i can see she really means it… but She promised it to me before and it happened again, and again","[2&&Arnell33&& NTA. She needs to learn her limits or stop drinking with you... you should talk to tell her how this makes you feel and that it really ruins a good time with friends every time. Also ask her if drinking this much is really fun for her. I bet it is not so she better learn how to control it. A good trick is to do a non alcoholic beverage after each alcoholic one. These things can happen once in a while... sometimes someone loses control and it can happen. But if it happens every time you guys are drinking together, it is a problem and it needs to be adressed. ]"

Why do you keep taking her to festivals? She always ruins it to the point you'd have been happier if you were never there. Worse, she's chipping away at your relationship.

"[1&&no_shitsherlok&&POST=IATA for telling my friend I won’t be friends with him anymore if he doesn’t get a therapist] For context: I(14F) and my friend Johnny (14M) have been friends for around 4 years. We were in class in primary school but then went to different schools in middle school. (I live in the Nederlands so the school system different) For some more context, my friend has always had trouble with his emotions and has had depression and did a lot self harm in the past. I have also struggled with depression and self harm especially during COVID, i got a therapist and got beter and I have never been happier I was in a friend group with him, my best friend Sophie (14F) and my other best friend Dylan (13M) for around 3 years, and stayed strong friend even after we all went to different schools. About 10 months ago I thought I might have feeling for him, but then quickly realised that I didn’t and that I just saw him as a friend. In March (at the end of the holiday) he came over to hang out with just the two of us, we were hanging out in my room watching a movie as he suddenly told me he liked me. I immediately felt uncomfortable and told him i’d think about it, he then left and I did really think about it but then concluded, I definitely didn’t like him and when he got home I texted and told him I just wanted to stay friends but that I still loved him and will always be there for him. He responded with yeah love only bring pain and drama, which I thought was kinda weird but I didn’t really think twice. I knew I was going to have to give him some space and it was going to be weird for i while. I got to school and Sophie walked up to me asking if I had heard Johnny I told her I hadn’t. I didn’t want to embarrass Johnny by saying that he liked me so I hadn’t mentioned it. It had now been a few days since he told me he liked me and was now also ignoring Sophie and Dylan. When he did finally text back in our group chat, he had said and I quote I'm going crazy stop calling holy shit do you want me dead or something. I was furious. He had been ignoring everybody for days, and this was his answer. I texted him back saying what the hell do you mean you’ve been ignoring everybody for days? It got a little she did, and he left the group chat. I texted him privately asking what the hell he was thinking why the fuck he texted that. He just responded with no talk please thank you, I was hurt and confused and didn’t understand why he would say that. A few weeks later I texted him and asked if he wanted to talk and told him I wanted to be friend and that I was there for him. He told me that 1 it wasn’t even about that 2 he was just busy and 3 he had only said that because he felt pressured into it. I didn’t quite understand, and was hurt and confused again. About a month later, Sophie birthday was coming up and I wanted to see if I could make everything better by inviting him to go get some ice cream for her birthday. He didn’t text back and ignored me, I kept texting him for a while kind of just explaining what I was thinking (where we would go, what time etc). He still wasn’t texting me back and I was getting annoyed I told him that she was going to forgive him either way so he should just text her back now. He texted back 1 = she has already forgiven me 2 = what should I be forgiven for 3 = I don't even know if I'll be there then 4 = it's my choice you guys we can't push into it. I was so done with him and talked back 5= you’re a bad friend. He got angry telling me that he had never been a bad friend. I sent him this huge text basically explaining that I found him selfish and that he was being a bad friend. He obviously didn’t agree with my statement and just kept saying when have I ever been selfish. I told him that I still wanted to be friends if I would get over himself. Then a month later I texted him again, hoping that this time he would wanna give it another go seeing if you wanted to hang out with the old friend group like we always used to do. He told me that he didn’t want to because it would be awkward. I responded that if we ever want go back to how it was than it would have to be awkward for a while. He told me that he hadn’t really been happy these last few months. I told him that if you wanted to talk that I was still there for him. He told me that talking never helped, I told him yes, it does help then it goes off your shoulders. He responded with I have experience with that, I was really angry now and I texted him i have experience with the two I think you forget that sometimes. He texted trust me I never forget anything, I was just like what does that mean? But instead I just texted him back with, but we can talk now. He then responded with and I quote talking is boring. I felt like a pushover and my feelings were incredibly hurt. I couldn’t believe that my friend of four years had said that to me. (I know it’s a little dramatic, but I really had been trying for a while.) I told him sorry that I have followed him, and I that I was really trying. He just responded with I know that’s. I texted him back no, I don’t think you do. He then basically told me that I should stop trying to help him. So I did I told him that I won’t text him anymore that I wouldn’t try to see if he was okay, I would just stop. He recently texted me, saying Hey … we should meet up again (maybe it's an idea to meet up with all of us but that you just come half an hour earlier so we can talk about things and after that you can just go back home if you don't want to stay with Dylan and Sophie:) I ignore him but he just kept texting me, I responded with look I am just not ready to talk to you yet I don't know if I'm going to do that later but I know I'm not going to now because honestly still angry and disappointed. He was in my opinion, at least acting as though he was dying tomorrow saying I understand if you don’t wanna be friends with me anymore I’ve been such a bad person and I can’t sleep. I was just kinda over it. And kept telling me that these last few months have been really really hard on him. He told me that I meant the world to him and that his friendship with me really meant a lot to him and stuff like that. He also texted apologies to my friend Dylan in Sophie, they had both already forgiven me, and Dylan had begged me to also forgive him. A few days later I texted him telling that I would only be friends with him if he would get a therapist, and I would help him with every step of the way, but if he didn’t, I don’t think I could be friends with him anymore. He texted that he was confused and didn’t understand that I was saying. It got realty he did, and if you guys want me to go in for sorry for that I will, but this is getting really long so I don’t think I will but in the end I told him that I was done and that he could figure it out. I’ve talked to friends and family about it, and I personally don’t think on the asshole, but I really want your opinion on it.","[1&&MadaMadita2&& Yes, URTA …. Let him healed….

"[8&&Affectionate-Ad-6722&&POST=IATA for telling my mom she's not invited to a road trip she invited herself?] A few months ago, my husband reunited with his biological father, and recently, his father invited our family (my husband, our two kids, and me) to his hometown, which would be a 10-hour road trip. He kindly offered to cover the gas expenses and provide accommodations for the weekend, allowing us to spend time with him and his wife. This would also be the first occasion for us to meet my husband's siblings and experience an extended visit with that side of the family. Naturally, I was thrilled about this opportunity and shared the news with my mom, including all the details. Unexpectedly, my mom later texted me saying that she would be joining us on the trip. Both my husband and I were taken aback because we hadn't anticipated her inviting herself. While I deeply appreciate the care she provides for my kids while I'm in school, I believe that this particular trip should be a private and intimate moment for my husband and his father. It was a generous offer from his father to cover the expenses, and I felt it would be overwhelming to have my mom accompany us on this specific occasion. I gently explained to my mom that this might not be the best time for her to come along, but assured her that we would be more than happy to plan another trip where she could join us. It would be a time when we take care of the expenses ourselves and have more days available for the visit. Unfortunately, she was disappointed with my decision and shared her feelings with the rest of the family. While I understand her perspective, I believe it's essential to respect the boundaries of this particular family gathering. It was crucial for my husband and his father to connect without any added pressure or distractions. I don't feel that I am in the wrong for suggesting a different time for her to join us and expressing the need for communication beforehand to avoid misunderstandings. However, I do feel conflicted about not taking her with us and understand her feelings to some extent.","[1&&Arnell33&& Definitely NTA.

He then explained that he had hidden 1300$ in the shorts' pocket. I explained everything to him, he became enraged and left for work.

I called my sister and asked her to check the pockets before washing it, but she couldn't find any money. I continued searching throughout the day, but still found nothing.

"[3&&Electronic_Check2030&&POST=IATA for breaking up with BF (M21) after I feel he SA me (F27)] To give context which I feel explains my reaction, last year I was raped and filed a report with the police. Someone I was dating very briefly (we had seen each other 3 times when the incident occurred) got me very drunk (black out drunk) and anally raped me while asleep/passed out. I am slowly getting over this. Six months ago I started a relationship with someone I had met and really liked. I was able to talk to him about the previous rape, and he knew very intimate details, and how I felt about the whole situation. About a month ago, there was a sort of neighborhood party (BF lives in same neighborhood) where I went overboard and got too drunk. My BF did not go to the party, he had stayed at home, not drinking. I got home to him, vomiting a few times, being generally very drunk, he helped me get to bed. The next morning I woke up feeling strange, and told him this. He immediately admitted (honesty being one of his best traits) that during the night he thought I wanted sex and so had started to penetrate me vaginally, but stopped when he realised I wasn't moving or reacting. I was very upset by this, and even more so I think because I had found out that same week that the report I had filed for the rape last year was closed for lack of evidence. I told my boyfriend how he had made me feel. Mostly like a terrible person, because if this happens twice in a year, am I the problem? And how can I morally justify the fact that I would report one man and not another for basically the same thing? (I have not and do not intend to file a report against my BF, but I regret having filed for previous person) I told my boyfriend I needed space to think, and that we should stop sleeping together for a bit, because I felt very betrayed and honestly did not trust him anymore. The next weekend we had a 4 day trip planned from way before to a music festival. I was slowly getting over my problems in being intimate with him again, and the trip was going ok. Not great but ok. We were able to sleep in the same tent, even though I did not want him to touch me, and was not ready for anything sexual. Especially at a music festival where we rarely had access to showers, and the tents were practically on top of each other. Zero privacy. Then what made me tip was on the last day of the festival, BF woke me up by tapping me on the shoulder and asking me if he could cum in my mouth. He was masturbating beside me in the tent and was close to finishing. I refused and generally felt like an absolute garbage bin for him. A week later, after coming home, I decided to break up with him because I can't imagine a time when I will be ready to be intimate with someone again. I feel I do not trust men, even the ones you thought were good end up losing control sexually. BF is taking this break up very badly, saying I'm the love of his life, and it doesn't matter if we never sleep with each other again, he can wait. He is generally very mopey and constantly crying, where as I am closed off and distant. I have rarely cried over the break up, only in the shower. This means that now the entire neighborhood thinks I am an asshole, and all that he is telling people is that he fucked up and I won't forgive him.

As a victim myself, my advice to you is... it's not your fault it's not because of your behaviour -, it's not because you ""asked"" for it it's not because you dress/ behave like a W IT IS because the men around you believe you're an object and not a human being. IT IS because these men are weak and take advantage of those less cognitive. THEY DO NOT KNOW MEANING OF LOVE IT IS because they have been taught that taking you out for a meal means you have to give them sex willing or unwilling.. Take time for you right now.. I would seriously encourage you to get help from Rape Crisis councillors, they are wonderful.. you want to change your perspective from Victim to Survivor so that in future you have all the tools to see the red flags even before they start flying and the relationships you enter are healthy and have mutual respect and trust. I am now married for 34 years to a wonderful man that loves me, encouraged me to become me, loves me no matter what, he is my best friend.. could not have gotten here without the help I received from the councillors.. due to my background, I did not even know that what had been going on in my life was NOT normal- I found out in school at 15 when a rape councillors came to talk to the 14 to 18 year old girls (went to all girls school). ]"

"[2&&randogirl01&&POST=IATA for wanting my mom to leave my dad now?] I 14 f. My parents aren’t married. My dad has been drinking for a long time due to his own issues (drinking before he met my mom) my mom has had to forgive him time and time again. Examples He drank a lot once and bad mouthed my mom to his side of the fam (I was like a baby) about how she didn’t take care of me that well. When I was 7-ish they would always get into fights one time they got into a fight about his drinking my mom thought he left and he actually slept in the car. There are more I can’t remember right now Recently about a couple months ago he got drunk while taking me to eat after school (I have suffered with $h and throwing up food when stressed and anxious) I did end up throwing up after eating a muscle but he bribed me to eat it with $200 so thats my fault. But after (we ate at a shopping center near my school) I went shopping bc I’m a stupid kid and tried to use this to my advantage. When I got into the store my dad started talking about his business to one of the worker to “help them” bc they wanted to work in the the same field. My dad was basically pressuring him in and wouldn’t budge, I felt embarrassed the entire time. Then after that I went to hot topic and he waited inside with me as I looked around (my fault) I went into a dressing room and he thought I left and I had the car keys he though idk what but he left the store and I called him on my phone after I bought what tried on. He was outside looking for me. We were both upset (mostly me) I gave him the silent treatment the car ride home. A couple days later told my mom. Usually when he sobers up he says. “I’m sorry I’ll try better next time… it won’t happen again…etc.” and I can’t be mad at him anymore m just mad of what he does. When he’s drunk and my mom is mad he sleeps in my room so I have to sleep I’m my parents with my mom. This usually happens if I’m away and he drink in the daytime. If he drinks when I’m asleep it’s either my mom forgives his and sleeps in their room or sleep in the car. Yesterday, my mom said she tried to call my dad and he ignored her till he got home like at 3-5 i don’t remember. But he crashed in my bed. I was like “mom is mad” in my head so I went to her room the door was locked. I knocked she ask who it was and let me in she explained what happened and she’s sick of him doing this guilt tripping. She doesn’t know if she should leave him now or till I’m in college idk what to do. She was watching vids on how to leave a narcissist and stuff. I love my dad but I can’t with this I felt like relapsing gain. But I don’t want my parents to know that. Ik my dad loves me but I can’t. I don’t know what to do he’s said he’s try rehab but he hasn’t. If you’ve seen the Elvis movie from 2022 where Priscilla leaves him that how I imagine them separating. My mom was crying about not giving me a good dad but I told her its not her fault while trying not to cry. I want to cry but I can’t. My mom is worried about me for many reasons. One is addictions both grandpas were addicted to something (one to heroin the other alcoholic) my dad alcoholic and me and $h. I constantly feel like this is my fault bc my mom wants what’s best for me but she wouldn’t be here if She didn’t have me and I was a “surprise” they’ve never gotten married which I’m happy but confused about.

But maybe a little bit AH because you put her and your husband in this position without reflecting and discussing your role in her creation before marry him, and apparently until now you continue to keep that from your partner. I think you and your husband need urgent therapy. I mean, family therapy. it's good that you're taking care of yourself, that you know how to recognize your triggers and are looking to improve. but you need to work on family unity and how you will deal with his daughter together from this moment on. I don't know what you expected, I don't know what her personality traits are. But you married him knowing that he had a daughter, that she had no mother and would need a mother figure. Children are independent beings, they grow up and have their own personality. not all mothers like their children despite loving them and not all children like their fathers despite loving them. they are two very different things, and it is ok. You don't have to be perfect to be the best mother figure, conversation is always the best strategy and form of creation. admitting that you make mistakes, have flaws and need help for your child does not make any mother worse. For example. if she's sneaking out and in the lying phase, be open about how you got through it, how it maybe didn't go well. She will continue to make her own mistakes, regardless of bans or punishments. The best way to be a mother is to let her know you are there for her when she needs advice, support or help. Establish with your partner what is up to him and what is up to you. Take what responsibilities you can, be honest with your partner about it, and leave her the responsibilities you can't handle. But if you don't think you can fulfill the role of mother figure, you need, for the mental health of the child and your husband, to leave their lives. Leave this space for someone who can provide what they need. just like you need your mental health they also need, because you can unintentionally may be causing emotional damage ]"

SD is in her early teens and I know is important that she has a strong and reliable female figure in her life, even thought her personality triggers me, I'm in therapy trying to heal so I can be present in a healthy way. Her mother disappeared when she was still a baby so I feel it is expected from me to be that figure for her, and to be honest I don't like her nor I feel her as my child, which make me feel as #IATA.",[1&&Silia_ta&& I think u are not AH cause she isn't your daughter and u cant feel her as your daughter. I think the best thing for you to do now is to make a conversation with your husband and your husband's daughter ]
"In my opinion you are not AH for not liking her. But maybe a little bit AH because you put her and your husband in this position without reflecting and discussing your role in her creation before marry him, and apparently until now you continue to keep that from your partner. I think you and your husband need urgent therapy. I mean, family therapy. it's good that you're taking care of yourself, that you know how to recognize your triggers and are looking to improve. but you need to work on family unity and how you will deal with his daughter together from this moment on. I don't know what you expected, I don't know what her personality traits are. But you married him knowing that he had a daughter, that she had no mother and would need a mother figure. Children are independent beings, they grow up and have their own personality. not all mothers like their children despite loving them and not all children like their fathers despite loving them. they are two very different things, and it is ok. You don't have to be perfect to be the best mother figure, conversation is always the best strategy and form of creation. admitting that you make mistakes, have flaws and need help for your child does not make any mother worse. For example. if she's sneaking out and in the lying phase, be open about how you got through it, how it maybe didn't go well. She will continue to make her own mistakes, regardless of bans or punishments. The best way to be a mother is to let her know you are there for her when she needs advice, support or help. Establish with your partner what is up to him and what is up to you. Take what responsibilities you can, be honest with your partner about it, and leave her the responsibilities you can't handle. But if you don't think you can fulfill the role of mother figure, you need, for the mental health of the child and your husband, to leave their lives. Leave this space for someone who can provide what they need. just like you need your mental health they also need, because you can unintentionally may be causing emotional damage","[1&&New-Lynx-6690&& thank you for your honest answer. Actually they are days where I do really hate being around her because she is so stubborn and acts like a mini wife, and I think it's not fair for her or my husband so I isolate. I love my husband so much but now the greatest act of love will be leave them alone since I'm not changing as fast as I would like. I put so much pressure on mature myself to stay that Im doing the opposite. ]"

"[2&&Secrets_for_us&&POST=IATA for not hiding my happiness from my depressed roommate?] I need to know if I’m the Ahole in this situation cause I’m not sure. I’ve been living in apartment style housing with 2 other people (3 of us total) and everything been great with one of my roommates, E, however my other roommate, A, is someone I dislike. E and I are both exchange students who live relatively close to each other so her and I have bond and get along really well and will see each other when we go back home however A is not an exchange student. When I first got there I was really nice and super friendly but A had begun to make snide comments about me and pretty much told me she didn’t like the way I interacted with her. But never the less I took a step back and changed the way I interacted with her being a little less friendly and more distance while getting closer to E in the process. I still offered A to hangout and do things with us be she often passed on the opportunity. About a month after that she asked me “Do we have a problem?” Which kinda took me by surprise because I had been nothing but nice. She once again told me she didn’t like how I interacted differently with her than I did with E. After this I stepped back completely stopped inviting her place and was only civil to her not mean but not nice. She clearly did not like me. We come from similar backgrounds yet I have a better grip on my situation. We both come from well off families with high expectations of us, with adhd and I recently finished my battle with depression while A still struggling. This is not to say I believe I’m better than A in anyway. I empathize and have tried to be a pillar of support but I’m not going to shut down my life and happiness to make her feel better. But I feel as though she disliked me because I didn’t reflect her. I’m not going to change myself or hide my progress or success to make someone else feel better. Anyway I’m not really sure how to proceed with the whole thing. She’s living at home right now and it’s so much better. Both E and I seem so much happy when she’s not wrong. But I need to know if I’m the Ahole for not hiding my happiness to make A feel better about herself?",[1&&Signal-Session-6637&& NTA. In fact being depressed will only bring both of you down too.

"[4&&starconvulsions&&POST=WIBTA for not forgiving my boyfriend for cheating on me?] (For disclosure, English is not my first language.) I (21F) have been with my boyfriend (20M) for over 10 months now. This happened last month one day before our 9 months ""anniversary"" (we always celebrate monthly). We spend the whole day toghter. My parents took us to another state just for a festival. That day we hugged, kissed said we loved each other, did a bunch of things together and I slept on his lap in the back of my mom's car on our way back to our city. It was one of the most special days we spent together. Monday (12) it was the brasilian version of Valentine's Day, and when I was having lunch with my sister she told me she heard somewhere that my boyfriend cheated on me right after I left him at his house on the day of that trip. I couldn't believe he would do something like this to me, especially because he always swears he loves me so very much. I decided I wasn't going to confront him through messages, so I decided to go to his house (also bc I had his gifts for ""Valentine's Day"") and ask this to him personally. At first, he denied. But when I said I was going home, he didn't even wanted to walk me to my car. That's when I was sure he definitely did something and was just trying to hide from me. While I was driving back home, i texted hum asked if there wasn't anything he should tell me, and he swore nothing ever happened. But I wasn't having it. So I decided to tell him I knew what he did because someone told me. That was when he finally admitted. At first, from what I heard, I thought he was just hitting or giving hopes to this girl he used to work with. Thay have been friends even before I met him, but they have almost a 3 year age gap. But he admitted to me that they actually kissed. I obviously couldn't believe this, so I begged him to tell me everything: She (I'm gonna call her Izzy) was dating this guy and they broke up like two months ago Izzy started hitting on my boyfriend (she knew he was with me, I even met her at his birthday party last year) saying he was amazing at his job Then she started saying she wanted to kiss him, which he replied with: ""I can't because I'm dating someone, but just wait a little"". (This part was the one my sis knew and told me about) For the course of a week she kept sending him these type of messages, even though they were still working together and he was with me On the day of our trip with my parents, when he was back at his house, Izzy send him another message saying she was in love with him, and he decided to give her his address. She took an Uber to his house (this was already past midnight), he took her to his room, they talked for a bit and then she kissed him For my surprise, he told me he kissed her back. After all this happened, he drove her to her house in the other part of the city (he always calls me an uber, especially when it's past midnight) The next day we had planned having lunch together (it was our 9 months ""anniversary""), but he got ill, so I went to his house and gave him some stuff to make him feel better, like an Gatorade This happened on the first hour of May 1st, and I found about this at June 12th. He spent this whole month acting as if nothing has ever happened. I've been on the same bed he kissed her. I feel disgusted. He told me he doesn't know why he did this, specially because he loves me soooo much. I can't believe a thing that comes out of his mouth anymore. This is the part where I may have been the asshole: Right before Halloween last year we both went to a costum party together. I drank 1/3 of a vodka bottle straight. I don't know why I started acting this way when I got drunk, but I spent the whole party running away from him. He didn't left me alone and I was getting very irritated, so I decided (only in my mind) I was going to break up with him. About like half an hour before this, this guy came to me asking if I wanted to kiss him (this is very common in parties in Brazil) and I said yes, because for some reason I don't know I wanted to get back at my boyfriend from annoying me. 10 seconds after the kiss started, I pushed the guy away and started screaming that I had a boyfriend (I don't remember most of it, but one of my boyfriend's girl friend saw this happening and told me the next day). Now he's making me feel very guilt because I did this to him. I know getting drunk is not an excuse for cheating, but at least I ""did it"" (I wouldn't consider that a kiss at all) with someone I didn't know. The girl he kissed was one of his best friends. He knew she was into him, and even we've been together for almost a year, he invited her to his house knowing her intentions. Now I really don't know how to feel. I went to his house for half an hour for us to discuss this and I couldn't even drop a single tear and look at his face. But now he's blaming me for what I did last year, saying he forgave me even when this happened. I don't even know if I should forgive him as well or not. I guess I feel more betrayed than cheated on.

Here's why: you don't trust your girlfriend. You already know kinda sorta but not really where she is- she's on a girls' trip with her friends. That should be good enough. You shouldn't need to check up on her. And yes, having your S/O constantly calling to pester you while you're trying to party with your friends is definitely ruining the moment. And super embarrassing, as is you texting her friend to find out where they are and what they're doing. And you shouldn't necessarily expect her to be calling you or even available to chat. She's busy with her girlfriends. How would you feel if the shoe were on the other foot? Would you want to be subjected to the same treatment from her if you were on a trip with your friends? If you're behaving this way because she has been unfaithful in the past, this shows you haven't really forgiven her and moved past it. You need to do that, or just end the relationship instead of doing what you're doing. You're acting like TA. If she's never gone that far, but has a history of saying and doing questionable things, you need to be asking yourself why you're in a relationship with someone like that because dude, you're acting like a crazy person. It's not a good look. If that is the case, then it's more of an ESH situation, but in it you're still behaving like TA. If she's never done anything nor given you any reason to doubt her fidelity, then I'm following up my assessment of YTA with a WTF. Deal with your need for control and your insecurity issues before they cost you a girlfriend, if they haven't already. ]"

He was a truck driver who smoked throughout his youth, as far back as I can remember he was an elderly man with coughs, and two years ago he developed throat cancer, which was easily treatable, but his stubbornness didn't help, he stopped therapy twice , and there was no other way but to remove his larynx. I don't understand much about medicine, but he had to have a definitive tracheostomy, and he would be able to speak with the right training and with a speaking valve, but he doesn't want to ""Learn to speak because he's not a child"". In short, today he communicates through mime and lip reading, I need to stare at him and deduce his joke, he doesn't like cell phones and thinks writing is too slow. I had an argument with my mum for not trying to understand what he says, I just laugh and nod and walk away, for two years straight he has chosen to give up the ability to communicate in exchange for comfort, if he didn't make the effort in speaking do I have to make an effort to ""listen""?",[0&&[deleted]&& You posted this in the wrong sub.

I have lost sleep over this many times and expressed my frustration to him to which he says that I shouldn’t wait for him to change because he won’t (which is weird to me as he promises on other instances that he loves me and will stop hurting me) It all boils down to a few days ago where he charged at me (again) with hurtful messages, calling me useless, stupid, ugly and that he’s only here for my body. I felt so disgusted because he said that he even makes fun of me with his brother who agrees that no one will want me because i’m way too stupid (I suffer from body image issues and that really just broke me) He then came to me the next day saying that he was sorry and that he didn’t mean any of the stuff he said to me, asking me if we could move on from this.

Yesterday when my boyfriend was at the tattoo shop, I received a message from the man I supposedly cheated on him with. I had no contact with him. He added me on social media and I didn't know who it was. When he told me that he was the only thing that asked me was if I knew where his girlfriend was who is in the same university as me..

He decided to go to the north of France, where we live to see his family and get some fresh air, not wanting to argue with him anymore and knowing that his family hadn't seen him for more than six months too, I helped him take his ticket, kissed him and said goodbye to him because he normally goes back on Sunday. Yesterday night, since his train was late, he decided to call me to tell me that he would arrive home much later than expected. I asked him why he didn't answer by message and he decided to tell me that it was suspicious, he hung up on me. This morning when I woke up and tried to send him a message via social networks, I discovered that he had blocked me from everywhere and that he didn't answer me anymore.

But at the end it’s part of the life. He act as an asshole and a kid by blocking you and not wanting to solve things as a proper couple. And if you continue to chase him or be with him after this types of actions it can lead to a toxic relationship, where he will get mad at you and blame you and repeat the cycle.

We didn’t have the friendship that started out as “first look and we knew we’d be good friends”, but, “ohhh she looked like a bitch and I don’t like her”. Over the time we had common friends who hanged out with each other and that’s how we became friends. We were honest about our first impression of each other and laugh it off. We became really good friends, we hang out, watched movies, went of coffee and boba dates. She was really a good friend to me. After some time I had to quit the job where we both work due to some health concerns and we remained friends. After a few years, I had to work in a different city. We don’t see each other much expect once a year. Then, COVID hit. We did not see each other for a few years. A little info: we have a low maintenance type of friendship, we don’t text each other often, but we knew we got each other’s back. I’m now back in our hometown and got a job as well. Now, I don’t have alot of friends. Not bcos I’m a bad person. I just don’t have the energy to bad vibes. I’d rather have a small but real circle of friends. I am having second thoughts on our friendship bcos of how she asks for $$$. She always ask if she can borrow some. Which I really don’t have most of the time bcos I have something that I am strictly saving up on. We do let each other borrow cash before, small amounts. But that didn’t happen much when I moved to a different city. I already mentioned to her that I’ll be having a very tight budget but would make adjustments for our once a month meet up provided we don’t go anywhere that’s too unreasonably expensive and she agreed. Now, my parents and sister saw it as she only contacts me whenever she needed to ask me if she asks if I have money available for her. And if I don’t, we always ends the conversation as ok meet up soon. My sister wants me to rethink of our friendship if its worth continuing or do I slowly cut her off. I don’t mind confrontations, except it’s about money. Any thoughts?","[5&&59flowerpots&& Just get a spine and say no every time she asks for money unless you are feeling generous.

It's painful now, but eventually you'll both find the right life partners. ]"
"[8&&Successful-Health619&&POST=I broke my girlfriend's heart and I hate myself for it.] I (24M) she (22F) have been in a relationship for 8 months, I know it's not a very long relationship but it was a relationship where time went by so fast and slow at the same time... Many things happened in this period of time that amazes me, I love her A few days ago we had a big fight that lasted almost 4 hours that didn't come to anything, we got together the next day to solve things but she felt that it couldn't be done and she decided to break up with me (it was said that we both want different things in family life, work, etc.). That day I couldn't sleep Two days later (today) her mother calls me to go see her... apparently he hasn't been able to sleep well and she isn't eating. when i meet her she tells me that she regrets everything and that she wants to go back. The thing is that she was right, we both want different things in life, I want to start a family, she doesn't. I want to live in an apartment with her or some friends. She with her parents, etc. And since I'm stubborn, that idea stuck in my mind that to make her happy in the future I had to break up with her so that we don't suffer too more. So we both cried for almost 4 hours. up to now God I never thought seeing her so destroyed would hurt me so much, I love her very much, and I don't know what is right anymore. i want that she be happy... Am I being stupid? Update: Well it's been 3 weeks since, well the break up and a lot of things happened. And since it's Valentine's Day, why not a update? I didn't go back to her. but. She tried to get us back. This happened 2 days after the post. She calls me. I answered. She said ""let's heal together"", ""come to my place"",""you have until midnight to come"", sending photos of us, ""i need you""... And again I felt like my heart was breaking and hers as well when I rejected her. I told her that I would not return to her in that situation. Due to an ultimatum. and. and hangs up the call. We were crying. Then her mother called me. I answered. (I think I'm a masochist) I thought that I deserved whatever she told me. She insulted my friends, my little manhood and she threatened me that if something happened to her it would be my fault. after that my family got involved as well... because they heard everything. It wasn't a very long fight. But it felt like the point and apart of everything. Our everything. Since then my friends have told me that she has posted on hers different social media posts about our relationship. Now she uploaded a tiktok implying that I cheated on her. (Yay) Seeing her change into this... it hurts a lot, she is no longer the woman I love. Really thanks for all your answers. At first my doubt was born because... well, we are young, 25 and 23(this year) was it still too early to think about it? But with everything that happened I don't know what to think anymore. The only thing I want is for her to be okay. And if I can be just as well, it would be ideal. So i thing i am not the asshole...",[1&&SpellFlashy&& You’re both going through an oxytocin withdrawal.

You will lose loved ones to death, distance, Life changes, and other people. Sometimes, it will hurt like it does now. Sometimes less, sometimes even more... Yet your heart keeps beating, and the world keeps turning. And you move forward. Experience will teach you the hard way if you do not learn, that you can only move forward. To move backward never, EVER, works. Sometimes, you can move forward, and circle back to try again, but generally, no. I am so sorry for the both of you that it didn't work, and that you are both hurting now. But as others have said, better to suffer now and move on. Good on ya for being able to intelligently realize that you have different goals. Different habits and different opinions can grow and change. But goals are what motivate and propel us through Life. When you compromise on those, you compromise on yourself. And major goals like children and living arrangements are not things you should easily compromise on. It will get better, trust. ]"

We never call each other pal unless it’s when we are not cool to talk about something. PAL is “People Are Listening/Looking” Good example is when a friend calls me and I answer and say “heeeey, what’s up pal?”. My friend instantly knows that he needs to watch what he says. We used to use this way back when I was in high school (around 2004) and it saved us a ton of times. Lol, we used to use codes for smoking weed or buying weed. When we said “let’s go to IHOP and eat some pancakes” it meant we were gonna go blaze.

This has never happened to me before which is what makes me feel like crap, disliking someone that much just because it's so different from me, or maybe because I feel on the side whenever she's there (even the brother who's pretty chill and nice with me acts different whenever we're all together).

I'm very shy socially speaking so I always considered it was a huge breakthrough when I started going out more with my bf's family and friends, but now I feel very uncomfortable all over again every time she's there and I think that's why I can't seem to like her or get interested in her (mind you, I've never had a problem listening to people's different interests but I'm honestly not interested at all in whatever she does), and even though I must confess my efforts to get to know her better have been minimal, those very few conversations have been so awkward (probably because of me, huh) that it really seems it might be mutual but who knows really. Yesterday was the highest point for me. We got together for the brother's birthday, and we started to play catchphrase and they made me pair with her. The dinner was making knots in my stomach when it was our turn and she never put her damn phone down, sometimes didn't even pay attention to the game, or when I tried to describe the word she'd look at me with a very puzzling expression, like she's trying really hard to understand me (although to be fair she does that every time I talk). This has never happened to me before which is what makes me feel like crap, disliking someone that much just because it's so different from me, or maybe because I feel on the side whenever she's there (even the brother who's pretty chill and nice with me acts different whenever we're all together). So, yea I know IATA because of not making the effort, nor am I sure if I want to, to get along with her but really just wanted to say it somehow, nobody else in my life knows about this.","[2&&lichatteMaloire&& Update in case there's someone interested: Feeling this much inside made me finally decide to talk about this with my boyfriend and with our common friends, and it turns out she's not really liked that much by anyone else: His parents and a third brother agree that whenever she's around with us she seems incredibly disinterested and almost like she's forced to be there, which is a high contrast compared to when the brother is with her family. Our friends say she comes off very rude making faces when she's talking to them. I am somewhat relieved that it is not just me who's picking weird vibes from her, which I thought I was because of what I was emitting myself but seems like she's a little too much to handle for everyone. Now the brother is not very open with me in this regard but he has told my boyfriend he's also starting to feel overwhelmed by her (she's starting to passive-aggresively make marriage suggestions when he's not thinking about that yet, expects him to pay for her birthday party stuff, food and travels all the time, not very into his interests which is fine but her complete disinterest seems like it's starting to hurt him a little). I don't know for how much longer I'll be in this situation. Tbh it really sucks but I'll be there because I love my boyfriend and his family, and I'll support his brother if he decides to stay with her for the long run, I'll respect his opinion and won't be nosey. All I can do is keep being civil with her like I have done so far, had a few very short convos here and there but I'll be mindful of my own space too, and if I'm not interested in her I know now I don't have to be so I'd rather not pretend and just stay in my lane.

I think you shouldn't rest on your laurels just because you recognize and accept your dislike. She has as much right to be part of the family as you do, and your social inabilities and shyness do not grant you special privileges in any family. I do think you wussed out with the word thing. You don't have to like her. You don't have to get along with her, you are more than welcome (encouraged, even) to simply smile politely when you are together, and then go about doing your own interactions and not interacting with her at all. My SIL and I have reached that point, because in the past, she's tried to make me feel out of place for being such a ""full"" personality, and I let her know that her opinion was noted, but wasn't going to make a bit of difference in how I lived my Life...At family gatherings, she does her thing, I do mine, and beyond a polite smile when we first greet each other, I ignore her, she ignores me, and the rest of the family ignores the non-interaction between us. Life goes on quite well. The word game thing was her not so subtle way of letting you know that she feels about you the same way you feel about her. Women do tend to pick those vibes up pretty quickly. So, you have no obligation to interact with her. NOW, you have to put on the big girl shoes and simply stand up for yourself. Shy is one thing. Letting yourself be an unwilling doormat is another. You get NO awards for not speaking up, no matter HOW hard it is. If YOU don't love YOU enough to stand up for yourself, who do you expect to do it for you? And how do you expect to be a functioning human being around others? Being an asshole is far more complex than not liking someone for no perceivably obvious reason. You're only being an asshole to yourself for letting yourself get away with not addressing the situation. To everyone else, you're just being a doormat who tries too hard. You don't have to be rude, you don't have to be an asshole. Simply tell people ""We have different personalities, and so I'm not comfortable being paired with her for this game (or any and every other situation when people try to play you both off against each other)."" And then, you simply don't play. ]"

"NTA. I think that we can growth with lots of insecurities and see someone came to a place that before you don't have ""competition"" and now have can cause it.

And you don't need to like but she is the girlfriend of him and make people pick a side with nothing really bad (taking that annoying a side) happen.

Me (F37) and him (M28) have 2 lovely girls together and love them very much. We are together for last 2 years but our story is 9 years old. We are very good together, barely arguing and have lots of love for each other. I am way older than him and I really would like to legalise our relationship since neither of us is interested to be with anybody else. I get the idea of him not thinking of marriage since everything works for him as it is just fine but at this point I'm a bit frustrated with the fact we're not even engaged. In the past I have been in relationship for 9 years and everything went to fuck since my ex didn't want to get married. This situation really did my head in. I wasn't sure if that's because he didn't love me enough? Or I gave him this comfort spot without expecting much in exchange. This time round I don't want to wait that long just to find out I'm making same mistake. I kinda understand your ex. Us women like to know what we are standing on. And being married means that once you take a seat at this table there's no way you get to walk away because of any stupid reason. If your ex have same set of mind I think there could be a chance for you to get back with her. But if you're not sure of what you want to do with your life - please don't waste her time anymore, because time is the most precious thing you can give. ]"

"[2&&sharkoons666&&POST=IATA for not liking my mother?] Sorry for the novel, I want to give as much context as possible. I (23F) have had a pretty tumultuous relationship with both my parents all through my teens, but things are great between my dad and I now. With my mother, it's a different story. For context, she had a pretty bad case of postpartum psychosis when she had me. She stayed in the hospital for a while, I don't know all the details but she actually forgot about my dad and I for a while. My dad says she's a different person since, so in reality I've never known the real her. I've always found her very immature, like she has the mind of a child. She seriously lacks tact sometimes and doesn't get social cues like most people, so she can make situations very awkward. Those things have led her to embarrass me multiple times in public. For exemple, at the end of a hockey tournament, I announced to my teammates it was my last game that day and I wasn't going to play anymore. She made that all about her that night at the hotel conference room we had rented for the tournament: she stood up on a chair, made a ''toast'' to me because she was ''devastated'' I decided to stop playing, and proceeded to sing the most graphic, sexually explicit caricature of a popular song. I was horrified, and still haven't forgiven her for that. I'm working really hard on not holding grudges, but that was awful for me seeing my mom turn my bittersweet, nostalgic moment into a horribly embarassing one. She's apologized, but like everything she does that affect others negatively, she doesn't understand why, which is so frustrating because it's never her fault when others take offense to things she says or does. Another example of this was when a friend came by. Her mom dropped her off, my mom started a conversation with her asking her where's she's from (the mom in question is black, so already uncalled for imo when you first meet someone), and when she answered Rwanda my mom proceeded to go on about the Rwandan genocide like she hadn't met this poor woman less than 30 seconds ago. I'm sure everyone will agree that those things are annoying in a parent, and they're pretty extreme examples, but I can't seem to let it go and it irks me to the point that every tiny thing she does makes it so I can't tolerate her. On the other side, I have to mention that my dad hasn't been the best partner to her. He's a very hardworking, loyal, selfless man, but he definitely stayed with my mom out of obligation. I know because I've read the reports his psychologist wrote when he was in the military (I know it was wrong but I don't regret it, I understand him better because of it). It said he was unhappy in his marriage because my mom will never be the same person she was because of her psychosis, but that he didn't want to leave her also because of her state of mind. It's not hard to notice, even as a kid I knew my parents didn't love eachother and that it wasn't normal. I even wished for them to divorce. My mother is also not the best for him, she's talked to other men romantically online, and even though they were actually scammers (that's another story), the fact that she intentionally went looking elsewhere really hurt my dad's trust in her. On one end, I can't blame her because she's unfulfilled in her marriage, but on the other end, that's no excuse to go behind your partner's back, right? The worst part is I recognize my dad in my own voice when I talk to my mom. I'm afraid my dad's resentment for her bled onto me during all those years, and that I now have this attitude towards her by default. The condescending tone, the disregard, everything. I hate it but I can't help it! I try so hard to be patient towards her, because I don't want her to suffer emotionally or be unhappy. But tonight, again, she said something that made my blood boil. She knows I don't want kids and how much I hate the idea, but she blurted out of nowhere, looking at me with a pitiful look on her face: ''I've been looking at so much baby stuff lately, I really want grandkids... I know you're not ready, but when the time comes, it will be so great!'' I was speechless, like she just slapped me in the face. She said it in a way that made it sound like I should think about her needs, which made me see red. I told her I was never going to have kids because I don't want to give her the satisfaction, then I left the room because I didn't want to explode. I'm writing this as I'm trying to calm down. I know my mother is unhappy with the life she has, and I don't wanna make it worse for her by being rude to her, but I simply don't enjoy being around her. I don't even have the energy to fake it. I know, deep down, we'll never get along, we have nothing in common and I have no interest in talking to her, but I have no choice since I still live at home. And when I do move out I can't just cut her out of my life because I have family on her side that I love.

"[4&&ImpactSuccessful5618&&POST=AITA-yes] I (M26) seem to be having the same argument with my partner (F20). We argue like any other couple, it isn’t a lot and it isn’t violent however our latest argument seems to be playing on my mind a little more than usual. We argued and spoke about respect around the house for one another however before we managed to have a sit down conversation, looking back I was quite nasty about it. Comments like I do this for you I do not get the same back, if you don’t respect people you will have no one. My main aim is to always speak to her with respect especially when requiring it myself but I lost it. I don’t know if it was due to blatant lack of reaction I received from my GF but if so there must be a better way to communicate to get the ‘bothered’ reaction I wanted to show she acknowledged what I was saying. The worst part about it is, I don’t get on well with her mother as she has a lot of toxic traits, my partner is her own person but at times can carry these traits through in to our arguments. I make comments saying you’re being like your mum to see what I was saying in our most recent argument was reminiscent of how her mum is with her.

"[2&&MagicMama24&&POST=Aida for telling sister-in-law she needs to grow up be a mom and take care of her children for once] OK read it first off I would like to apologize for any spelling grammar or any type of error. I am on a mobile device using dictation because I am legally blind. Some context before the actual event to give an idea of the situation at hand. My partner D’s sister R is an abusive parent to her three children, but especially to her oldest child who is 11 that I will refer to as Jay. Jay has been through mental, physical, emotional abuse from her mother are. J has also had events of essay in the past. She has been recently diagnosed on the autism spectrum, and has extremely violent tendencies. my partner and I love Jay and try to help out as much as possible. She comes over and stays with us quite a bit to get away from our. CPS is aware of everything that’s going on but unfortunately has not taken much action in this situation to protect the children. CPS has received calls from school, daycare, family members as well as the greater community. now to the situation. Yesterday was our daughter‘s second birthday party and we had some friends over and family to celebrate. I was outside talking with my friend and when I came inside I heard my partner on the phone with his sister are and she was screaming at the top of her lungs. At this point I just snapped I guess, I told her that she needs to grow up take care of her children and to be a mother for once. Are responded how would I like to be hit every single day of my life. Ours referring to the fact that Jay will hit her, and her mother will turn around and abuse her right back. I told our the difference is that her daughter Jay is a child, and herself are is the adult and needs to act like it. Are then threatened to run into traffic and an ally of her self. at this point partner and I hung up the phone. Police called us back and intern told us that our was indeed running into traffic and every police officer there was trying to stop her. Jay is safe at this point at a neighbors house. However nobody is watching the two youngest children in the home. this whole event started because Jay hit our, so our told Jay that she was going to grab a knife and have her daughter hurt R with it. Partners mother has told caseworkers at CPS that we will adopt Jay if it comes down to it. Partner and I are refusing to adopt Jay because of her violent tendencies and being afraid for what might happen to our own child. J has been known to abuse other children as well as her own siblings in the past. So Aida for saying what I said to our, as well as refusing to adopt/take care of Jay. Our also told me that we should come and take Jay and take care of her if we care so much. We do take care of Jay very often. But our needs to grow up and be a mother and either have her children removed from her home and put in a safe environment, or steps need to be taken to help our with her parenting.","[1&&[deleted]&& You've posted in the wrong sub, this is r/iata, not r/aita. ]"

"[2&&bordstofustoll&&POST=Am I the asshole for not inviting my sister along with my other sister out to dinner?] Get ready for a long one. I'm gonna start this post with this 'incident'. I have two sisters and one of them, the younger one (both younger than me though) has a boyfriend. I like him and we got along just fine. The, they couple were in the city recently and we had this double date (I have a girlfriend), we didn't invite the other sister with us. She lives in the same city as I but we don't see each other that much. Now she is mad that we didn't invite her with us for this dinner. Now, the three of us have never gotten along that well. The two of them are so different in every way and generally don't get along. The sister who was not invited has some extreme opinions on gender fluidity, genders and just name it. We, the other siblings don't really think about that stuff and she doesn't like it when we talk about something she disagrees with, something that isn't politically correct. Just one reason why we don't hang out with her that much. Ooh I forgot, she has a Twitter account where she has blocked us (but of course with breakaway accounts we can see) and she regularly complains about us and the family in general, on a platform we are not supposed to have access to. Now they don't get along with each other but now for the reason why we don't get along. So I teased her when we were young (4 year difference between us) like every siblings do. I just realized two New Year's Eve's ago where my dislike comes from. Our dad doesn't like the situation between us and was very depressed that year. On New Year's Eve the sister who's not popular overheard him crying and talking to our mother. He was admitting to overly scolding me when I was little, scolding me when I didn't deserve it just because she was crying. He admitted that our relationship (which does not look like a father-son relationship) is kind of broken. We never have done anything as father and son and he blames himself for it. While I respect him I kind of feel the same way, our relationship is kind of broken. My sister told me about what she heard (I wasn't home, was with my in-laws) and it's like she didn't care at all about it, she said it so casually.

Don't get me wrong, we can be around each other today (I'm 31, she 27 and the youngest one is 22) but the fuse is very short, especially on her part.

Every special memory is tainted by them overreacting to something they didn’t like. Distancing yourself is probably best for your well being and sanity.

"[2&&bordstofustoll&&POST=Am I the asshole for not inviting my sister along with my other sister out to dinner?] Get ready for a long one. I'm gonna start this post with this 'incident'. I have two sisters and one of them, the younger one (both younger than me though) has a boyfriend. I like him and we got along just fine. The, they couple were in the city recently and we had this double date (I have a girlfriend), we didn't invite the other sister with us. She lives in the same city as I but we don't see each other that much. Now she is mad that we didn't invite her with us for this dinner. Now, the three of us have never gotten along that well. The two of them are so different in every way and generally don't get along. The sister who was not invited has some extreme opinions on gender fluidity, genders and just name it. We, the other siblings don't really think about that stuff and she doesn't like it when we talk about something she disagrees with, something that isn't politically correct. Just one reason why we don't hang out with her that much. Ooh I forgot, she has a Twitter account where she has blocked us (but of course with breakaway accounts we can see) and she regularly complains about us and the family in general, on a platform we are not supposed to have access to. Now they don't get along with each other but now for the reason why we don't get along. So I teased her when we were young (4 year difference between us) like every siblings do. I just realized two New Year's Eve's ago where my dislike comes from. Our dad doesn't like the situation between us and was very depressed that year. On New Year's Eve the sister who's not popular overheard him crying and talking to our mother. He was admitting to overly scolding me when I was little, scolding me when I didn't deserve it just because she was crying. He admitted that our relationship (which does not look like a father-son relationship) is kind of broken. We never have done anything as father and son and he blames himself for it. While I respect him I kind of feel the same way, our relationship is kind of broken. My sister told me about what she heard (I wasn't home, was with my in-laws) and it's like she didn't care at all about it, she said it so casually. There I had my confirmed reason why I don't like her that much. Don't get me wrong, we can be around each other today (I'm 31, she 27 and the youngest one is 22) but the fuse is very short, especially on her part. She is very dramatic and self centered and doesn't listen when others try to reason with her. I even think she might be bipolar.

"[2&&Hatsumemiku_197&&POST=IATA when I confronted my sister about how much pepperoni she had eaten] So me and my family aren’t wealthy so when we go to the supermarket in my country inflation is going to the sky so everything is more and more pricey so we bought the things we wanted on Monday and one of those things was pepperoni and the bag in my country kind of full like in the middle maybe a little bit more, later Wednesday when I went to eat some it was almost empty because it was like only only pepperoni in the side of the bag not just in a whole bag and it wasn’t like sideways it was like still a normal bag and I went to confront her about it (because only her and me eat pepperoni in my house and I haven’t eaten any until yesterday) and she says that she had eaten but it was at empty the. I showed her the bag and she said there still pepperoni left in the bag but I tell yes but it was filled at the middle of the bag and she told me no it was less and I told her that I saw it when I bought it so it was the middle then we started fight and I left it at that cause it late and I just wanted to go to bed, so now today we where talking like normal and then she brought up the pepperoni theme up again and. I told her that I knew that that bag was at the middle cause I bought it a showed a picture I thought at the market cause my mom asked where I was and in my cart you can see clearly the pepperoni bag at the middle and now she told I was accusing her of eating al the pepperoni and I told her that I was just asking hereby it was so empty an then she started being sarcastic then things and I told that stop cause my mom works of herself to put money and we can not waste the food that we have and the.

[4&&msmmlee&&POST=AITA for not agreeing to drive my cousin's son to catch a ride home at 2am?] My cousin from another state sent her 20 year-old son to my city to visit his uncle who also lives here. The uncle was supposed to drive his nephew back home but said his work schedule changed and he couldn't do it. My cousin's boyfriend is a trucker and one of his trucker friends was going to be passing through my city at 2am. My cousin called and asked me to drive her son to a truck stop at 2am to meet up with this trucker friend. I told her that I'd take her son to a bus station the next morning but that I no longer drive at those hours of the night/early morning. I also pointed out that the trucker friend may not even arrive exactly at 2am and I didn't want to end up waiting on him for who knows how long. This cousin has asked for bigger favors than this one so I've learned to have boundaries with her after doing a couple of those other favors. She could have purchased a bus ticket but she'd rather save her money at the expense of my time and sleep.

"[5&&TrashAltruistic9600&&POST=AITA for getting upset at my roommate over her cat?] For context: I (27F) have a 2yr old male dog who’s the sweetest. He has never hurt another cat, nor has he tried. I live in a studio type condo with a friend (26F) of mine who owns 4 cats. 3 of them get along with my dog all except for that one cat. I told my roommate before to have her cat neutered because he gets aggressive when my dog tries to approach him. My dog only wants to sniff him, but the cat immediately always tries to take a swipe at him. This causes my dog to bark at the cat. My roommate doesn’t agree to having him neutered because apparently somebody told her that doing so shortens the life of the cat coz they’ll refuse to pee as often, leading to kidney failure. So instead of arguing, we agreed on letting my dog take the other half of the room to stay away from her cat, but the cat crosses over to my dog’s side and tries to snap at my dog again. So instead of my dog taking half of the room for his space to roam, I put him in a tiny playpen where he sleeps right next to his pee pad, all so that the cat won’t hurt him. He sleeps there and spends most of the day inside that tiny space. Three adults can stand in the area, that’s how tiny it is. Seeing my dog sleep and play next to where he pees never bothered my friend. During the times when I let him out of his playpen, I always keep an eye on them because I’m scared of my dog getting scratched in the eyes. The cat’s owner (my friend) doesn’t do anything but expects me to be the one to watch over my dog since she’s confident her cat won’t get hurt. Going to what happened yesterday— i let my dog out of his playpen so he could stretch his legs. The cat was hiding somewhere. I made the mistake of turning my back for a while because later on, i saw the cat charge at my dog and my dog was barking. I immediately picked him up and put him back in his playpen then I saw blood dripping on the floor- it came from my dog’s eye. I panicked and immediately let my friend know. She was sitting a few feet away from the room and she saw my dog bleeding and the blood on my hand but she didn’t even bother to get up and check what happened, nor did she even ask how my dog was. I immediately rushed out of the room with my dog and my friend just casually asked where I’m going as if she has no clue what’s happening. The vet said that the cat tore my dog’s eye and that there’s a possibility of his eye becoming necrotic and that they would have to remove it. I was holding back my tears in the vet while I was carrying my dog. When I returned back to the condo, I messaged my mom about what happened and showed her pictures of my dog. This obviously upset her, so she called me to talk to my friend. My mom didn’t scold her, but her tone was obviously hurt and upset because she cried when she saw how my dog looked like. We casually talked and agreed that she should have her cat caged too for the times when I’m going to let my dog out of his playpen. I thought it was already okay and that she understood and agreed. Until today- I was sitting outside the room and my roomate who was inside messaged me. She called me careless and negligent, said that she found it unfair how my mom “scolded” her for being irresponsible with her pet. She went as far to call us poor in an indirect way and that the reason why she let me sign the lease on the condo is because she knew I was going to take longer to graduate than her because I got left behind (I slacked off 2 years ago when I got depressed). I told her she knew that her cat is the only aggressive one and not my dog. I told her that she knows her cat attacks even other dogs as well for no reason. But she still puts the blame on my dog for his barking which causes her cat to see him as a threat. Btw he only barks when he wants to get out of his playpen to play or when he wants to play with the other cats. She insists that all the blame is on me because I let my dog out that once and didn’t keep an eye on him. She insists that my dog provoked her cat by barking at him (he didn’t). It’s always my dog who adjusts and never her. My dog wants nothing more but to just make friends just like he did with her 3 cats. AITA here?","[5&&martydidnothingwrong&& Bro, with context here, they're a major douche and an idiot.

He sleeps there and spends most of the day inside that tiny space. Three adults can stand in the area, that’s how tiny it is. Seeing my dog sleep and play next to where he pees never bothered my friend. During the times when I let him out of his playpen, I always keep an eye on them because I’m scared of my dog getting scratched in the eyes. The cat’s owner (my friend) doesn’t do anything but expects me to be the one to watch over my dog since she’s confident her cat won’t get hurt. Going to what happened yesterday— i let my dog out of his playpen so he could stretch his legs. The cat was hiding somewhere. I made the mistake of turning my back for a while because later on, i saw the cat charge at my dog and my dog was barking. I immediately picked him up and put him back in his playpen then I saw blood dripping on the floor- it came from my dog’s eye. I panicked and immediately let my friend know. She was sitting a few feet away from the room and she saw my dog bleeding and the blood on my hand but she didn’t even bother to get up and check what happened, nor did she even ask how my dog was. I immediately rushed out of the room with my dog and my friend just casually asked where I’m going as if she has no clue what’s happening. The vet said that the cat tore my dog’s eye and that there’s a possibility of his eye becoming necrotic and that they would have to remove it. I was holding back my tears in the vet while I was carrying my dog. When I returned back to the condo, I messaged my mom about what happened and showed her pictures of my dog. This obviously upset her, so she called me to talk to my friend. My mom didn’t scold her, but her tone was obviously hurt and upset because she cried when she saw how my dog looked like. We casually talked and agreed that she should have her cat caged too for the times when I’m going to let my dog out of his playpen. I thought it was already okay and that she understood and agreed. Until today- I was sitting outside the room and my roomate who was inside messaged me. She called me careless and negligent, said that she found it unfair how my mom “scolded” her for being irresponsible with her pet. She went as far to call us poor in an indirect way and that the reason why she let me sign the lease on the condo is because she knew I was going to take longer to graduate than her because I got left behind (I slacked off 2 years ago when I got depressed). I told her she knew that her cat is the only aggressive one and not my dog. I told her that she knows her cat attacks even other dogs as well for no reason. But she still puts the blame on my dog for his barking which causes her cat to see him as a threat. Btw he only barks when he wants to get out of his playpen to play or when he wants to play with the other cats. She insists that all the blame is on me because I let my dog out that once and didn’t keep an eye on him. She insists that my dog provoked her cat by barking at him (he didn’t). It’s always my dog who adjusts and never her. My dog wants nothing more but to just make friends just like he did with her 3 cats. AITA here?","[4&&[deleted]&& You're in the wrong sub.

I don't know if you are planning on staying there, but if you do, i would set some boundaries. Did she ever consider getting pheromone diffuser or even calming medication? This should help with the anxiety the cat might have and help with aggression, though, the cat getting fixed would be the easiest and quickest solution.

The cat’s owner (my friend) doesn’t do anything but expects me to be the one to watch over my dog since she’s confident her cat won’t get hurt. Going to what happened yesterday— i let my dog out of his playpen so he could stretch his legs. The cat was hiding somewhere. I made the mistake of turning my back for a while because later on, i saw the cat charge at my dog and my dog was barking. I immediately picked him up and put him back in his playpen then I saw blood dripping on the floor- it came from my dog’s eye. I panicked and immediately let my friend know. She was sitting a few feet away from the room and she saw my dog bleeding and the blood on my hand but she didn’t even bother to get up and check what happened, nor did she even ask how my dog was. I immediately rushed out of the room with my dog and my friend just casually asked where I’m going as if she has no clue what’s happening. The vet said that the cat tore my dog’s eye and that there’s a possibility of his eye becoming necrotic and that they would have to remove it. I was holding back my tears in the vet while I was carrying my dog. When I returned back to the condo, I messaged my mom about what happened and showed her pictures of my dog. This obviously upset her, so she called me to talk to my friend. My mom didn’t scold her, but her tone was obviously hurt and upset because she cried when she saw how my dog looked like. We casually talked and agreed that she should have her cat caged too for the times when I’m going to let my dog out of his playpen. I thought it was already okay and that she understood and agreed. Until today- I was sitting outside the room and my roomate who was inside messaged me. She called me careless and negligent, said that she found it unfair how my mom “scolded” her for being irresponsible with her pet. She went as far to call us poor in an indirect way and that the reason why she let me sign the lease on the condo is because she knew I was going to take longer to graduate than her because I got left behind (I slacked off 2 years ago when I got depressed). I told her she knew that her cat is the only aggressive one and not my dog. I told her that she knows her cat attacks even other dogs as well for no reason. But she still puts the blame on my dog for his barking which causes her cat to see him as a threat. Btw he only barks when he wants to get out of his playpen to play or when he wants to play with the other cats. She insists that all the blame is on me because I let my dog out that once and didn’t keep an eye on him. She insists that my dog provoked her cat by barking at him (he didn’t).

"[5&&TrashAltruistic9600&&POST=AITA for getting upset at my roommate over her cat?] For context: I (27F) have a 2yr old male dog who’s the sweetest. He has never hurt another cat, nor has he tried. I live in a studio type condo with a friend (26F) of mine who owns 4 cats. 3 of them get along with my dog all except for that one cat. I told my roommate before to have her cat neutered because he gets aggressive when my dog tries to approach him. My dog only wants to sniff him, but the cat immediately always tries to take a swipe at him. This causes my dog to bark at the cat. My roommate doesn’t agree to having him neutered because apparently somebody told her that doing so shortens the life of the cat coz they’ll refuse to pee as often, leading to kidney failure. So instead of arguing, we agreed on letting my dog take the other half of the room to stay away from her cat, but the cat crosses over to my dog’s side and tries to snap at my dog again. So instead of my dog taking half of the room for his space to roam, I put him in a tiny playpen where he sleeps right next to his pee pad, all so that the cat won’t hurt him.

AITA here?","[1&&Sarm11111&& I’m sure there is more to this but plain and simple, move. Other then the smell of 4 cats being deal breaker for me from day 1, your dog is being neglected because you are still in that place. Dogs need some room, even the tiny ones. Walks every day and a small breed is ok for an apartment/condo but having to pen it up all the time for its protection is unfair to the dog and it’s QOL. If you cant move because of financial problems give the dog to someone you trust and will treat the dog well. Or move. In a situation like yours you actually have a case for them to pay vet bills for your dog, but it doesn’t help your dog so your roommate is no friend, leave, find better friends. Warning, cats are an indicator of a lazy roommate. I like cats but unless your on a farm cats are the lest maintenance and for many are little more then furniture. You have made a commitment to that dog for probably another decade plus. You make decisions now based on your and the dogs wellbeing. Your halfassing now so make the choice. If you don’t do what’s best for that dog, then you are the A. Your roommate may be the A in your eyes but you new she had 4 cats. Fighting like cats and dogs isn’t Only a quip it’s generally true especially between cats and dogs that didn’t associate as kits and pups. Castrating the Tom now will likely make little difference in his defensive behaviour towards dogs and def not enough to risk your dogs vision and health for. Move, or get ride of the dog. If you can’t afford to move you can’t afford that dog. As small friendly dog that you describe will make a older and financially secure person more happy and likely the dog. Do the right thing, you both are the he a-hole, but you only control you. Time to grow up. ]"

"I don't think your roommate is a friend and her negligence towards the situation is really sad! I hope you asked her to pay for part of the vet appointment. I don't know if you are planning on staying there, but if you do, i would set some boundaries. Did she ever consider getting pheromone diffuser or even calming medication?

"[1&&spyruss&&POST=IATA for trying to get a point across?] This might be a bit long, I'm not quite sure yet. So earlier this evening, my (28F) best friend (32M) and this girl he's been ""talking"" to (26F) met up for a trivia at a bar my bf (29M) works at. My bf is a cook. Boy friend - D Best friend - C Girl my best friend is talking to - E So my bf comes out to smoke a cigarette and I ask him to come to the table with C, E, and me. He comes over and I ask him to bring us some chips and fries. Whenever he's free. He forgets, gets off of work, and sits with us, so I bring it up again and was joking around about him forgetting me. He ends up bringing the things I ask for, which I thank him for. Trivia ends and we start playing cards. Everything seems fine... E goes to leave and C walks her out. Me and D and talking for a bit and C eventually comes back. D asks why I don't like E, and his his first citation was that I didn't like her voice. Which, in itself, is true, and does make me an AH but that wasn't my main reason. My main reason for not liking her is because she's really sketchy but that's a whole other story which, tl;dr, I've found evidence that she's living with her boy friend (possibly ex?) without disclosing that to C and dodges around the subject. C has opted to give her the benefit of doubt, and I remain skeptical. I tried to explain myself but C and D kept cutting me off. It got to a point where I raised my voice and then D literally screamed ""AAAAH"" at me, and asked how I liked being cut off (which, as a side note, he and C cut me off often, and maybe I did it as a ""last resort"" retaliation). I got mad and left, deciding to just sit in the car that D and I share until he got done talking to C. D comes out, asks why I'm being mean, I tell him because he's being mean, and go to explain, but he walks away and goes back info the bar. I get even more mad and drive away, 100% intending on coming back to get him. He calls me and I lose service, I try to call him back while driving back toward him and he never answers. I drive by the bar, don't see him, drive by our home, don't see him, and circle back around. When I finally found him, not even half way between home and his work (which is only a 20 min walk) I pulled over and asked him to get in the car. The second he does, he asks me ""why are you being such an asshole"" and goes off about me ditching him when he had to walk to and (half way) from work, that he left me the car as to make sure I didn't have to walk if I needed anything. I kept trying to explain but, like I said earlier, he kept cutting me off to tell more of his side of the story. I didn't even get to explain at all why I was upset with him, even though I listened to him in full the whole time he essentially cussed me out (which, in itself upset me because I'd never do that to him). I get why he's upset, and he has every right to be because I definitely handled the situation in not the best way which I said to him, but, I'm wondering if ITA because even though I heard his side and he's not 100% wrong, should I even voice my greviences over the situation?","[1&&lizj62&& Info - is it normal for him to talk over you?

"[1&&killerrkunt&&POST=Should I apologize for making jokes during a convo about someones religion?] T.W for mentions of suicide! ⚠️ This week I met someone who told me that they had died before. They’re a pastor and when I asked what they saw they said they saw Jesus. I am not catholic nor christian but I am still superstitious but also try my best to be logical at the same time. I know some things don’t have an explanation. When I was younger I sort of believed in God but as a I got older my view changed. The concept doesn’t make sense to me and is honestly extremely cruel. I told them when I was younger I used to “believe” in God out of fear. I said “ I used to treat prayer as making a wish, too.” And although it was a joke, I meant it. The pastor told me they had actually died twice and that they met jesus a second time. When they said this I jokingly said “And jesus said ‘Girl you again?’“ and I started laughing. I was listening to the pastor throughout the whole conversation and didn’t think they were lying. The pastor mentioned that suicide is a sin and sends you to hell. I said “I tried to kill myself when I was 16.” and they said “You would have gone to hell.” I told them that idea is cruel and unfair. They said “Jesus took all our sins at 12. Do you think thats too young?” And I replied with “If Jesus truly knew he was a god, he wouldn’t have to question whether there was one.” I took the conversation seriously but with a few jokes here and there to get a some laughs out of the pastor and the other person I was with. I wouldn’t have any proof of whether they lied about their experiences and I took them for simply what they were. Their experiences. When I got home I told my sister about it thinking it would be an interesting story to tell her. When I told her that I was adding a few jokes throughout the conversation but nothing that could be seen as disrespectful. My sister said I could have come off as insensitive and should think about apologizing. The pastor wasn’t an extremely serious person and understood that there are different beliefs and opinions. I didn’t think I said anything disrespectful. We debated about the idea of suicide being a sin but I didn’t think it was rude. But because of what my sister said I’ve been overthinking and wondering whether she’s right. Should I apologize?",[1&&IndustryKnown779&& Ofc you should ]

"[3&&NayMarine&&POST=IATA For quitting my job of 2+ yrs without notice because I didn't want to be exposed to a meth addict.] I started working with this plumbing company two years ago. I could tell right away they were the don't ask don't tell kind of people who don't mind a few shady under the table things going on. I started as an apprentice so I did not really understand some of the dynamics of the job at first. However the first call I went to was to go and rework some crappy plumbing done by the one we will call MC. I was of course paired up with a journeyman, we will call him JT. The first thing he told me when we pulled up to the house to meet the Master Plumber was how shitty this guys work always was. So we fixed the piping the guy installed all janky and went on about our business. Little did I know at the time but MC and JT were both smoking all sorts of drugs not just pot. Fast forward almost a full year. I have been working with JT and we go through about 10 plumbers every six months super high turnover rate for such a small company we are talking less than ten employees. I have at this point learned that when the new construction side of the business gets slow JT and me are charged with going back over MC's crappy work with regularity since he was paid commission and we by the hour of course it was just our job. I though very little of it. When we were not fixing the other plumbers mistakes, mostly MC's we were working our asses off in the heat. I found out later on that a major part of why JT was working so hard without eating anything everyday was because he was smoking, snorting all sorts of things many of which came from MC. Now I should not have to tell you that trying to outwork someone on hard drugs as a sober person is not easy or even possible some days. No food and water for 8+ hours is like torture. It makes me very irritable and I get migraines when I'm not hydrated properly or for that matter fed. This goes on for a while until I say something about it to HR. Their solution is to take me off the truck with JT and start having me ride with other service plumbers all two of them.. MC and another plumber who left so fast I wont even mention him. Eventually I take over the other guys van just to clean it out an get shifted back to being rotated as soon as they hire another plumber with more than an apprentice license. This is the first time they do this to me but not the last. So MC has been fucking up real bad we still fix his shit, and then it happens. The initial incident that prompted the Local Authorities to raid his house with a warrant. His drugged out gf/SO ran over one of their 3 children with the truck. The 8 yr old boy suffered a crushed lung, broken collar bone, ankle and severe lacerations, and other injuries sustained. He survived thankfully, however the police found felony amounts of Meth, guns, paraphernalia and other things like THC vapes which are also a felony in this state. Que the song and dance from the Master P and his wife the ""HR person"". Oh we fired him finally after 3 years, of them letting him work there. In that time he cost them thousands of dollars in damages from flooding houses, or in general crappy work, not to mention all of the extra hours of work JT and myself clocked covering up and fixing his mistakes. He was gone for about 8 months before he came back begging for his job or as he tells it MRS. HR was begging for him to come back.( HR had a completely different version of the story of course) He would work 14 hours days, while other guys were doing six times the work in almost half that time. He was still a slow plumber he had to think about it very hard just to glue on a 45 degree fitting. Working with him was extraordinarily frustrating after having worked with a less meth'd out plumber who did better work than him. They also took me off the van they had promised me, to give it to him. This really pissed me off since this was the second time they had done this to me. Now I understand I had a lesser license than him, but to just tell someone to clean out their vehicle just to give it to someone else without even telling them was a huge red flag for me. So I go back to working with JT and some of our other plumbers. MC is now on CPS probation and double drug tested with a patch etc. Occasionally they would have me work with him and he was the same old, slow; foul smelling meth addict he was before. Only now he was ""sober"", anyone who knows about hard drugs knows that they set your life into habits and cycles that are hard to break. In his case not eating anything or drinking anything but energy drinks all day. They expected me to keep up with an addict? Not long after him returning there were several instances where we worked together and he made huge glaring mistakes that a person with a Journeyman's card should know better than like putting on a PRV valve backwards (they have a one way directional flow indicator arrow so you know which way) and on the wrong side of a city meter.(We are not really supposed to touch any city stuff). Flooded another house. I tried to tell Master P and HR that this was a problem, they brushed me off. They thought I was just hating on the guy. Which absolutely I was hating on a fucking meth addict! They didn't have to smell the dude everyday, his stench was so bad it gave me headaches. Beyond the dangerous work conditions, it was frustrating beyond measure to have to work with someone with a superior license and inferior skills. Even our Master P was a raging alcoholic did better work, and Mrs. HR almost never let him do anything but bids because of his drinking problem. Him and MC were best friends because they covered up for each others fuckups. Times like when the Master P went out and cheated on his wife, or nearly killed an old man in a road rage incident ,etc. I saw the writing on the wall and told as much to our Dispatch who was always friendly with us. She promptly had the owners come and meet with me this last Thursday Master P, and Mrs. HR. Things went south very quickly as I mentioned to them I was having a problem keeping up with someone on drugs, they reassured me that he was sober because of the patch, drug tests etc. I happen to have had more than one run in with Meth addicts in my life. When I asked JT about it ( a ""former Meth user"" according to him) He confirmed what I already knew the grinding of his teeth no eating no sleeping the dude might have been on patches, etc. but he was still in meth mode. After explaining this to the Owners they began to berate me with comments about my workmanship. How many things I had done wrong, most recently when working with MC following his instructions caused damage to a homeowners cabinet. So it was of course my fault since I had done the cutting. They tried twist things around to make me out to be the bad guy so I stood up and told them if that was how it would be. then I was out of there no more comments questions just I'm out. I walked out and told them I quit no notice. (Texas is an At will state this also meant they would not have to pay me unemployment Master P mentioned this when HR said she would fire me.) I told them several times all I wanted was to not have to ride with a meth addict. They refused so I quit despite HR's best efforts to attempt to lure me back I walked out of there arguing with HR the entire time got in my truck and calmly drove away. I went down the road and got hired the very next morning at another plumbing company! Good riddance to a den full of meth addicts and their enablers. TLDR: I refused to continue working with another employee who is a known meth addict. In response my employer began to berate me with insults so I walked out and told them to get bent essentially.*grammar& spelling",[1&&[deleted]&& So why did you stay there so long? Definitely NTA. ]

I said ""at this point in time"" because I don't want to imply that he is this or that as a person without knowing him personally. I've personally experienced the situation you are in without children, but with pets between me and my current spouse. When we first moved in together the amount of work between me and her wasn't balanced, I took care of the animals, paid all the bills, tried to keep laundry clean, the apartment clean and buy and cook the food. It's a lot to ask of one person in a 2 person commitment. She was jobless at that time. Here's the important thing though in my situation, she has severe epilepsy that at that particular point in time and actually until recent was uncontrollable and unpredictable. Getting hired was hard, being able to work a full time job was even harder for her. You mix that with bipolar depression in her case and it's a recipe for a really hard time, which I understood. Also due to her epilepsy I wasn't able to work a full time job at the time either, due to having to be with her most of the time in case she would have a seizure. She also was self aware and was trying to do what she could at that time, which albeit wasn't much but at least she tried. This was 2 years ago, she very recently got hired at a job that she likes so far, been there for a week. Her seizures are a little more controllable and predictable. She helps around the apartment including with the animals now, and soon whenever her payroll kicks in she'll be helping out with half of the bills and taking all that stress off of me. That's another reason I imply ""at this time"" with him, is because once he gets pushed in the right direction it might actually lead him to go further and further.

Your husband is lazy and selfish. He is taking advantage of you, using you to support him. He only takes, he doesn't give. That's not going to change, because he doesn't care about you. Your task is to decide whether your life is better with it without him. Don't bother nagging or yelling or fighting. None of it will do a bit of good. Either accept the status quo, or divorce him. Personally, in your situation I'd choose divorce. His behavior will only grow worse over time.

Background story: My mom finalized her divorce with my bio dad when I was 6 months old because he was a D*** addicted, we moved to the US and she got together with my step-dad, a few months later she got pregnant and had my sister (20), and 2 years later had my brother (18), my step-dad always treated me like his own daughter and his family did the same thing so I didn't know he wasn't my bio dad until years later, my mom and him separated when I was 5 and we moved back to México, he kept in touch and sent us money every now and then. My mom then told me about my bio dad when I was 9 years old because he wanted us to meet up, I love him and my step-dad equally, when I was 12 my bio dad died because of liver failure due to his alcoholism, so I was left only with my step-dad again. Around this time, he came back to Mexico because his girlfriend was pregnant... they were together in the US for 2 years and then she moved to Mexico a year before my step-dad came back, she had an affair with her ex-husband (which she already had a daughter with) and got pregnant, but my step-dad decided to stay with her and raise the baby as his own. We never had a problem with this, until that B**ch he calls wife decided that he shouldn't spend time with us, she slowly convinced him to stop calling us and then stopped inviting us to go and visit him so we distance ourselves. Then she was poisoning our relationship with him even more when she started telling him that we didn't make an effort to visit because we hated her and our new ""sisters"", that wasn't true at all, we just didn't want to be where we weren't wanted. When I was 15 we moved back to the US and since then we tried calling him a few times but he was always busy or had something else to do, so we stopped call him 100%, we receive a ""happy birthday"" each year thru Facebook, but he never responds anything after that. A few years ago one of my uncles (my step-dad's brother ) said that my dad was hurt because his children didn't call or show interest in him or our ""sisters"". My siblings and I responded with ""well, that's because we have no father and no sisters"", I guess he told my step-dad because one of my cousins later mention that he was crying a few times saying we don't love him anymore, but we didn't really care.

"[2&&moresha&&POST=IATA for not giving back $65 of the deposit to my male flatmate?] Let me give you the context: This was during the mini- lockdown where I was the one house-hunting while he was busy on a shoot. I did it all by myself talking with real estate agents, travelling kilometres in the summer heat to get a house for both of us. I had to keep my work aside to get this done. The said flatmate was getting out of a live-in relationship of four years. His stuff was still at his ex-gf's. He then informed me that a previous ex was interested in a relationship. And he asked whether she could move in, I had to say no as our agreement was just the two of us. Once the shifting was done, she started coming over and staying for 10-15 days in a month. My work is absolutely tiring and i need some peace and quiet at the end of the day. I politely asked him to let me have one day to myself, where she isn't there. He threw a fit, yelled at my house-help and left with the gf. He didn't do any flatmate duties. He would cook only when she was around that too omelette's and made it seem like he does this everyday for everyone. As a result, I had to put my foot down and tell him that I will be taking a specific day off during the week when she is not allowed to come over. He crossed that boundary not once but many times. He then got married to this girl. Yes, this happened in a matter of 8months. Things came to a boiling point when he again crossed the boundary and got her over when it was my day off. I told him this isn't done, he started yelling and got in my face. I then lost my shit and yelled at the top of my voice to get the point across. I had to take a month's break, as my therapist told me that the toxic environment plus compassion fatigue is taking a toll on me. I am glad I took the break. Made me come out stronger but this wasn't the end of his shitty behaviour. Then the landlord wanted to increase the rent and we decided to go our separate ways. I was glad in a way. While I was at work, he sends me a message saying movers and packers our coming in an hour to pick his stuff up. I had to rush because I didn't trust him with not taking my stuff, which he managed to do anyway. I was supposed to finalise a flat that day but i couldn't due this interruption. He left his room and the kitchen in a mess. I asked him to get it cleaned, he said the house-help will do it. I mentioned to him that you need to pay her extra as this is not part of her job. He didn't say anything, just left. I had an extra pair of curtains I had given him as his were worn out. He did not wash the curtains in a year and he had the hall to return them to me without washing them. Who does that? He always yelled, cut me off and didn't let me speak. So tell me folks, IATA for keeping his 65 dollars?","[2&&Away-Discussion-4291&& He is an AH, personally i wouldn't want to give him that back...i would just say that that money to pay the cleaner for all the mess he did.. ]"

It's been a nightmare but I am glad it's over. One year felt like 20 years of hell. And yes, that money went to the house-help. She has gone out of her way to make sure we were comfortable. It wasn't part of her duties to make us breakfast or get us stuff. She was with me for 6 years. She has seen me with different flatmates. Majority we both are in touch with and some have become good friends. She was really hurt and upset with his behaviour. I have never seen her like this. I don't give a damn about him now. ]"

"[11&&SadSis_throwaway&&POST=IATA for suggesting that I would not go to my brother's wedding if the guy who made inapropiate sexual advances towards me is invited?] Hi! I made the account because my brother has reddit and I don't want him to find out. Also I'm not english speaker so I'm sorry for any mistakes For context: My brother (M29), Matt, and me (F27) are very close, and always get along. He has always take good care of me and we trust a lot to each other. Two years ago, our parents went to live in another city and the both of us rented an aparment together. It was great and we manage it well. One time, my brother invited his best friend, (Let's call him Mike) to the aparment to hang out and have a drink. The three of us know each other since childhood; his family and ours arevery close so we alwasy hang out together; I'm a bit shy so I dont always hang with them, but this was the first time he came to our apartment and and we wanted to have a good time drinking. We started drinking, I don't really drink that much so I only had one beer. My brother and Mike, however, got drunk really fast and we were all laughing. My brother was wasted (he's a big man but cannot hold alcohol) so Mike and I carried him to his bedroom. After I made sure my brother was ok I went to the living room to clean a little bit because I was tired and I thought Mike was going to leave soon. He sat down the couch and asked me to hang with him, so I did. He was talking about going to a party later that night, and invited me. But I told him I was tired and did not want to go. He did not push it but he started glaring at me with a half smile and asked me why we never did anything just the two of us. I wasn't sure what was he refering to and I was getting unconfortable so I stood up and went to the kitchen to clean. He followed me there and continued to push the idea of the party, to which I declined again. After that he cornered me up against the kitchen counter and stared at me smiling. I was scared did not look him in the eye because I just wanted to leave. He is a really tall man so I felt scared, but as he was my friend I thought he would leave me alone. He then put his hand on my hip and came in for a kiss, I refused and turned my head, but he tried again. And then I told him ""NO"" in a whisper. He asked me ""no?"" to which I repeated myself. He laughed and let me go. I ran to my room and locked the door. Few minutes later I felt him trying to open my bedroom door and I was nearly crying at this point. My brother was wasted and slept, my parents lived in another city and this guy was huge and completely drunk. Luckily he desisted a few moments later and left my house. I couldnt sleep. Next day I told my brother what happend and he was angry at Mike. Made him call me and apologize to my. To Mike's credit, he did, he apologized and since then nothing else happend. However I cannot be around Mike anymore because I feel unconfortable. Two years have pass, I made clear to Mike and my brother that I did not want any contact with him, My brother respected this and told Mike to not try and get close to me (He had tried multiple times since that night to make friends with me again but I always refuse). My brother told me that is my choice and he respects that choice. Now,I moved to live on my own few months ago, and my brother has a girlfriend that I adore, we are good friends and they are thinking on getting married soon. He and I where talking about the marriage and I asked who would he invite. He told me some family members and friends and then told me that Mike was going to be invited as well. I was surprised and he noticed it. He told me that is his wedding and he can invite his friend. And I told him that I was still not confortable with Mike. He has tried to make contact with me before this year, asking my brother for my phone numbrer (he gave it to him and we had a fight becuase he did not respected my boundaries. He later apologized but he told me that what happend with Mike was not a big deal beacause he stoped when I told him so) My brother is adamant that I cannot avoid him forever and that I cannot miss his wedding for a small thing like this, that I can avoid Mike and that he can talk to him before the wedding and ask him not to aproach me. I told him that Mike has tried to make contact with me even when I told him that I did not wanted it. I had to block his number so he could stop talking to me. He asked me if I was seriously thinking of not going to the wedding because of Mike to which I did not know what to answer. He got mad and I got mad at him. Though we did not push the issue any further and I pretended everything was fine. I really don't want to be mad at my brotherm because he has supported me during really dificult times. I don't really know what to do. So, Reddit, AITA for thinking about missing my dear brother and sister in law's wedding becuase of Mike?","[2&&rododepia&& NTA, sorry for that situation, i would've panicked too. Look, if he's still going to invite mike to the wedding, i suggest you to let him know again what he had done to you, and not just him but his bride too, i think that another woman can help him see that what mike did to you was really traumatizing. if he still wants to invite him, my another suggestion will be that you stay close to your family members, all the time, and try to let another person of your family, perhaps a female cousin (someone who will have your back on this) know it too, so you can be around them all the time. sending love to you💖 ]"

I have been feeling really mad at my family for, acording to me ,playing favorites with my brother for a long time. We just have had a little fight about it and I`'m crying, also I`'m pretty sure I made my mom feel pretty bad. I(18F) have a older brother(24M) and I have feel for so long that my moms(51F) favorite kid is him and she has been really unfear with me in everything, but what is the issue right now is money. Also, I come from a country where womens are treated differently than men. So, since I have memory my mom is way harder and stricter with me that with him. I was a just A student and the only time I fail a class I was yell at till the point I cry,and I had to look for some one to take me to school on Saturday to take a extra class so I would't fail the class and I had to pay it from my savings. while this my brother use to fail so many clases because he didn't care and even when he was the same age or even older my mom would take him to the Saturday's extra classes, pay for them, pay fot private teachers, never yell at him, etc. I would also be told to shut up all the time,while he can say whatever he wants, or I will be call lazy for waing up late(8 am) but thats because I usally go to sleep at 2am because I'm doing homework from college. While when he did the same he was never Bothered. I would be yell because I'm gettin ""fat"" and unhealthy because I dont excersice a lot but he dosen't needer and has never been bother about it. If something is dirty is my fault and responsability but not his. Now, this as context, but the fight today was about money. I try to be really considered about not expending to much monet, but whenever I ask for something I'm told no, but if he ask for anything my mom will always give him anything. By the way I dont work because thats something really difficult to do while studing in my country, but I'm looking ways to star making my own money. My parents pay for my tuition and food, I try to spend as less as I can in food by only eating in the cafeteria from my college and if I ever go somewhere nicer the next day I would not eat lunch but an apple so I dont have to ask for that much money, this is something my parents never ask me to do but I just don't want them to feel like I'm taking to much money. I also haven't bought any clothes in at least 2 years, I don't go to concerts or partys while all my friends do. Despite this whenever I ask for nice things like money for a concert, a new laptop(mine is broken) or a weekend they tell me no because they had been spending to much lately(in my brother). But whever my brother ask for a new car(I have never had one), or laptop, or to go travel with his girlfriend, he gets it. A few weeks ago they gave him over 30.000 US dollars for a work thing(even when he has ask in the past fot money for work and it never ends in anything) and they gave it to him! while I'm here with a broken laptop, no car, no going out with friends or anything because everytime I ask they tell me there is not enough. So, today I ask for 300 dollars for a laptop because mine dosen't work any more and mom told me that she didnt have for that, even when I know she does. I told her crying that I feel that it was unfair that there was always money for my brother going out, traveling, buying things, investments and all but for me there was nothing more than tuition and food. She say I was been ungretfull and mean with her and my brother. She got mad and my grandmom told me thet she had arrive home crying. I know that I have a huge privilege of having someone paying for my tuition and food, but I just feel that my brother always has everything, they also paid for his tuition years ago, food, partys, car, expensive phone and laptop. Even now that he is way older and working she gaves him money for traveling, investmen and everything but I have to stop going out with friends to have fun, don't eat with them every day in the nice restaurants but go by my self to the cheap one and all of that while my brother had and have all the money he wants.

I have been feeling really mad at my family for, acording to me ,playing favorites with my brother for a long time.

I(18F) have a older brother(24M) and I have feel for so long that my moms(51F) favorite kid is him and she has been really unfear with me in everything, but what is the issue right now is money. Also, I come from a country where womens are treated differently than men. So, since I have memory my mom is way harder and stricter with me that with him. I was a just A student and the only time I fail a class I was yell at till the point I cry,and I had to look for some one to take me to school on Saturday to take a extra class so I would't fail the class and I had to pay it from my savings. while this my brother use to fail so many clases because he didn't care and even when he was the same age or even older my mom would take him to the Saturday's extra classes, pay for them, pay fot private teachers, never yell at him, etc. I would also be told to shut up all the time,while he can say whatever he wants, or I will be call lazy for waing up late(8 am) but thats because I usally go to sleep at 2am because I'm doing homework from college. While when he did the same he was never Bothered. I would be yell because I'm gettin ""fat"" and unhealthy because I dont excersice a lot but he dosen't needer and has never been bother about it. If something is dirty is my fault and responsability but not his. Now, this as context, but the fight today was about money. I try to be really considered about not expending to much monet, but whenever I ask for something I'm told no, but if he ask for anything my mom will always give him anything. By the way I dont work because thats something really difficult to do while studing in my country, but I'm looking ways to star making my own money.

"[7&&SquareProduce5963&&POST=AITA for telling my friend she used a natural disaster to promote her mommy blog?] My best friend and his wife (my partners best friend) are currently suffering through the flooding in North West Washington. Last night they had to huddle for warmth in the second floor of their home while their garage flooded and water lapped at their front door. As soon as I saw the news (I live in California) I called them up and asked what I could do to help.

Today she posts on all the horrific photos on her social saying how grateful she is for all the support she’s received and the comments have flooded in of “support” in her post she mentioned how she’s almost done with a new post on how to survive flooding with a 1 year old.

While her husband (after evacuating them) went back to their house to try and get as many supplies as possible. When I called tonight to update her on the progress I made, she said how thankful she was and how she hardly had time to think with everything going on it was all just adrenaline.

She said yeah she did once the got to the hotel and that she’d be posting later tonight, she was just seeing if she could get a sponsor. I had put my life on hold to help them and she goes and works on her mommy blog, I made a comment about how I was surprised she had time to work on it, and she tells me that I need to get my priorities figured out and she needed to “work” and not everything can be put on hold, mind you she hasn’t worked since college 10 years ago. I was so mad that I said they could figure out how to get after the fact flood insurance since they weren’t smart enough to get it in the first place, and it was super shitty of her to use an event where people are dying to promote herself and her worthless blog.

"[1&&Thatfakeblonde&&POST=I’m an ADHD Adult F Up] I’ve always had responsibility problems since I was a kid. I try my best but my impulses get the better of me. During COVID, my existing depression got worse. So I impulsively decide to blow off my registration until I couldn’t. I end up not doing two semesters of college and told no one. Well my mom found out and was livid rightfully so since I lived with her and she paid for most everything. I am now back to school trying to take one day at a time but I didn’t realize I would have a new impulse. I’ve spent over $700 in a month and a half on food. Which also has ruined another goal of my mine I’ve been trying to loose 35 pound for a year. Understandable my mother is upset again since she needs my help while she’s recovering from surgery. I honestly didn’t think I did anything wrong until last night when we realized why I didn’t give more that $50 per week and often none. I don’t really know how to fix anything and I’m afraid of my adhd medication and I associate it with anxiety. It will flare up an anxiety attack. Now I have anxiety thinking about how I will always be an f up and an a-hole. I don’t think anyone here could help me but it’s worth a shot.","[1&&WinRarIsGreat&& Not the asshole. You're ill, you're not doing this on purpose. I don't have ADAH but my partner does (plus depression, anxiety and other mental health issues), so I'd say I'm in a similar situation as your mom. For me, sometimes is very hard to deal with my partner and not make her feel guilty of how overwhealming it can be, but I know it's not like she's not trying. I think it must be the same for you. You're trying. And you might feel that it's frustrating that even though you're doing your best, it's not working. I'm not a therapist or a professional, but from personal experience I'd say that you should try to communicate as much and as often as you can with someone, specially with your mom. If she's supportive (sometimes people don't really understand how serious it is) then it's a great starting point. Try to take notes and use a planner for your day, little goals, baby steps, one at a time. Keep tabs on your expenses daily and make sure to respect your limits. Hope you find peace and hope it gets better. ]"

"[4&&Big-Presentation3041&&POST=Am I (F-17 y/o) the mini-mom of my real mom (F-47 y/o) and my siblings (14 y/o and 9 y/o)?] Ok so... I´ve been having some trouble with my mom lately (especially since my parents split, back in December of 2020). The thing is that my mom doesn't know how to do basic stuff that is essential for living (for example, printing, paying bills, cook, etc), and she depends on me a lot to keep the house in order, and I´m getting sick of it. For example, she has a tiny business of food, but does she prepare the food? No, I am the one who does that. Her business depends on me, and I have to postpone my studies, my plans and my personal life so her business stays functioning. Yesterday I confronted her for the first time since March, telling her that I am not supposed to be doing half of the things that I am doing. I am not supposed to be cooking for the house, or doing the cleaning, or doing the dishes... She did not like this; she told me that I was taking credit for everything that she does, but she is always smoking and drinking, so I don´t know what I am taking credit for honestly. Even people that have never had come into my house have told me that I seem the mom and the adult of the house, but I´m only 17. My therapist told me that this dynamic could be the cause of my low self-esteem, which lead to my eating disorder. I don´t know what I am supposed to do with this situation without ruining our relationship (which by the way has always been very good). Please help me with advice, or let me know if I´m the wrong one here bc I really have no idea of what to do next. Ps: English is not my first language, so I´m very sorry if some stuff sounds weird.ps2: sorry if I am in the wrong subreddit!

Cooking dinner - I think a 17 year old can be expected to do that. Same with babysitting the siblings occasionally and helping out with the cleaning. But it sounds like your mom is a little incapable of managing her life properly. Having three kids and a business is a lot, for anyone. And she might not be able to do it on her own. If she is a reasonable person, you could sit down with her and show her a chart of what you do every day. How many hours devoted to “chores”? And how many for school, homework, sleep, exercise and social time? Maybe she will understand your feelings if she sees it spelled out. She probably doesn’t want a maid, but needs help. And it takes a lot of money to support a family. I would let her know you understand all that, and you care about her well-being, but you do need to set limits for your own life as well. With that said, when you are 18, you are an adult. You can leave. Although you will have to pay rent, and cook and clean for yourself. If I were you- I would make a 5 year and a 10 year “plan” of what you want for the future. It should include college plans, what career you want, and how you want your family relationships to be. Then work towards those plans. I think that will help you see a light at the end of the tunnel. And to look on the positive side, you are gaining so much wisdom and maturity by doing these tasks. You will know how to run a house properly, you will know the dangers of drinking and putting too much on your child, and you will know how important it is to have a great partner to raise children with and run a home. So, just think of the wisdom you are gaining! But you are NTA at all…you sound like an accomplished young woman who has been relied on too much, with a wonderful future ahead :) ]"

The worst part he wanted part of his older brother without him knowing. When my mom bought this up my grandma got red on there face ( i want there, i was making diner upstairs). The next day they showed up with the other uncle and grandpa. They sat behind our back and wanted to go to the juge to finish this. The stab in the back hurt. My mom wanted me out of the room but i stood my ground and i said that it is my house too and I'm an adult. I need to know if all that they said about my grandparents was true ( few weeks before all o this they told me that when i was young my grandma was using me every summer for money.

We want to build a new house outside the town that we live in behind there backs. Give them there part of the property and rent the house to other people. Our target is workers from Ukraine ( the prefers other people than us living in this house so they gonna get it). But i plan the biggest this with my mom. Go my grandma golden child, my cousin. I was raped by him and his friend when i was eleven, i got trauma from this. Now i hate touch even by my family. And now since I'm 18 i can hit him hard. I wanted to left this to the past and just move on with help or specialist. But now it's a war. My friends from Scholl think that it's a bit much. But i said no. this cousin is my devil aunt child. When she was babysitting me she forced me to eat till i vomited, tir my shose so hard i had a blue imprint on my leg. When she was living in the same house as me and my parent left me for the night on her watch i was upstairs in my parent apartment and she was down stairs. She left me from a whole night alone in the dark with no checking if i was eating. Once she even lest me to choke when i went to her for help. I remember all of that and i got more stories of my cousin and her. I'm a rightfully mad and now they messed with my mom, my dad and my sister. I will dance on there graves even if this killed me.

Our target is workers from Ukraine ( the prefers other people than us living in this house so they gonna get it). But i plan the biggest this with my mom. Go my grandma golden child, my cousin. I was raped by him and his friend when i was eleven, i got trauma from this. Now i hate touch even by my family. And now since I'm 18 i can hit him hard. I wanted to left this to the past and just move on with help or specialist. But now it's a war. My friends from Scholl think that it's a bit much. But i said no. this cousin is my devil aunt child. When she was babysitting me she forced me to eat till i vomited, tir my shose so hard i had a blue imprint on my leg. When she was living in the same house as me and my parent left me for the night on her watch i was upstairs in my parent apartment and she was down stairs. She left me from a whole night alone in the dark with no checking if i was eating. Once she even lest me to choke when i went to her for help. I remember all of that and i got more stories of my cousin and her. I'm a rightfully mad and now they messed with my mom, my dad and my sister. I will dance on there graves even if this killed me. Also my grandparents had like 5 dog in the last 2 year every time i was there is was a different dog. My grandpa was killing them and digging a hole in the forest. I'm and calling police for my ex grandpa. Is this to far? ( Sorry for bad grammar I'm am still learning. If you want to clear something up i will gladly do It.) If you want update just coment","[1&&Caitje_&& You're not the asshole. I can't imagine how much trauma you got because of this family. They get what's coming for them with the house. However, I wpuld try to be the bigger person, and not put all your energy in them. They're not worth it. After you have your own house, I would break all contact with them, and spend time with your mom, stepdad and sister. ]"

Sexual assault is a deeply private matter that victims have every right to keep private all the way to their grave. Where I come from, sharing someone’s account without their permission, especially to those (formerly) closest to them, is considered wrong and, in some cases, illegal.

Tiffany was going into my fathers room getting on his bed like shes been there the whole time. my father made me and her share bathrooms when i raised the suspicion again that they were sleeping toghter she packet her stuff and moved to my fathers bathroom. after that she got very violent (punching and cutting me) my father came in and pulled me off and i got a lecture but she got family time. after we came back my father kicked me out because i was trying to get a phone that she stole from me saying i was being disrespectful. so now i 17 is living on the streets. so my question is should i call the cops on them?,[4&&th3sp1an&& Call Child Protective Services.

"[7&&BloofKid&&POST=IATA because I am an impulsive fool] There isn’t much to this story but I still feel like shit about it. I went to the grocery store today to pick up some things. As I go through the store, I notice some meat products sitting unattended on a shelf with chips. I had this urge to move the products to a refrigerated area — I don’t want the meat to go to waste because of a lazy customer — but before I could get too far, a customer stopped me. Turns out the items were their’s and they were just steeping away to get a cart. I apologized and we went out separate ways. I was impulsive and possibly ruined somebody’s night because I could not entertain the thought that food left on a shelf belonged to somebody. And while what happened was not the worst thing in the world, I cannot stop thinking about how the other person must feel about some stranger almost walking off with their groceries. I just feel bad about the whole thing.","[1&&Uh_cakeplease&& NTA. NAH! You’re totally fine. You were doing a good thing and it was just a situation of misunderstanding. I’m sure that the other person hasn’t given it another thought. Try to be a little nicer to yourself, their food was still right there! They didn’t have to go find it! And even if they did, so what? No one got hurt, no one died. You’re not an asshole. ]"

"[5&&bckyltylr&&POST=Took my parking spot so I....] This was over twenty years ago during my first semester of college. I had been circling the parking lot for 20 min and decided to just sit at a particular alcove of spots and wait for anyone to come out and drive away. Classes let out and someone finally comes to their car and leaves. But another driver that had just showed up takes the spot I had been waiting for. Since classes just switched there's other spots open (albeit much further away. There's never enough parking at college, amirite.) So I park, walk in, am late to class and I'm seething the whole time. Not focused at all. So I leave early and go key the car that took my spot. I have no way to make restitution and I think about it often even after all this time.","[2&&HarrysOtherNip&& They definitely were the asshole first tho, parking lot etiquette is important! ]"

"[0&&jasmeac&&POST=IATA foe not wanting to sign a post nup?] Husband(35) and I (f31) have been together for 15 years. 12 of those years married. We started dating when I was 15 and got married when I turned 18 just after getting pregnant. We started out struggling financially because we where so young. When I had our 1st daughter I had to live with my parents because we couldn't afford to live together. My father helped out with buying diapers and my mom made it possible for me to get a job while she looked after my baby. Time passes and when our daughter turned 4 we where able to move in together. Mind you we never ended our relationship we just lived in different houses since he was embarrassed to be living woth his inlaws. After we move in together I become a homemaker and help him out in his business as much as I can. He took care of the bills and I took care of the child, him and the house. I was always available for him. I helped in his business from the outside. I staffed it and covered whenever needed. He never had to stress about our children (we have 2 now) I always took them to school, cooked, clean, drove etc etc. Old school type of marriage. He does know where everything in the house is or the name of our daughters teacher. But he paid the bills.(I used to get commission from staffing his business but that stopped for a reason I don't remember, that money I used for groceries and outings with the kids). His business is now booming. He became really successful. He doesn't need my help anymore since I'm not smart or educated anough for what it is now. I'm still in the same spot when we started our relationship just older and with more kids. He thinks it's not fair that we married so young and he didn't know what he was going to become. He tells me he doesn't feel safe knowing I can wake up some day divorce him and take everything he worked to hard for. So he is asking for a post nup. IATA for thinking it's nor fair to me? He says that if I don't sign is because I'm a gold digger whose after his money. That he knows how women think. He assures me in the event of a divorce he will make sure I'm taken care of. I asked for a cheating clause and he refused. I asked for a lawyer but he's not paying for it. He said i don't need one because I have nothing to protect since is all his. So basically is this or divorce. No I won't get anything in a divorce because he has been putting all properties and business in others people's name( I wasn't aware he had been doing this since the beginning) he now wants to take ownership of all and that's why he needs me to sign. He has been asking me to have another baby and I just found out I'm pregnant yesterday. He made the appointment for the post nup this coming Wednesday. He tells me the way I'm thinking is wrong. That I should not care whether I have access to his money. That's should not be my concern. That's a concern dirty gold diggers have. I only see 2 options for me; get a divorce and an abortion so I could get a job. Starting a life from 0 and pregnant would just be too much plus 2 girls going to school. Or second option sign, have baby and trust him. My daughters will hate me if I get divorced since I won't be able to afford the kind of life he has been providing for them the last few years.","[1&&fillosofer&& DO. NOT. SIGN. Sounds to me like he wants out but doesn't want to lose any money. Him telling you ""you'll be taken care of"" may be an absolute lie and you could end up with nothing for you and your children. If he really cared about you, he would set you before a divorce, right? ]"
