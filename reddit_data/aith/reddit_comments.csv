[1&&Vamp_svlut&&POST=r/AITH Lounge] A place for members of r/AITH to chat with each other,"[1&&clockworkprotoge&& Now I’ve got a question Went to a restaurant for dinner Got a very poor server at a time when the restaurant was not busy but the other servers just basically checked out and started doing their breakdown duty. I felt ignored trying to get their attention for basic stuff. Meal came they took until the end of the meal to get my drink (just water) Then nobody came to the table even with me raising my hand trying to get help. I stood up and went to the kitchen, found all the servers in there of which the only one that was actively working serving customers was the one for my table. I started yelling saying they needed to get up and help each other as this server was obviously swamped and she needed help. I said this is ridiculous, customers should not have to flag someone down to get a check. I was hoping for dessert but now I just want to get out of here. They peaked right up, said something about the other servers have secondary duties and my response was, that should not be at the expense of customer care and teamwork. When your teammate is in the weeds and customers are suffering they need to step up. Rolling silver, putting away dishes when it’s the end of the night comes secondary to customer care/teamwork. The owner heard me on this and peaked his head through the kitchen and seemed pleased with what I was saying. He actually came out to the car to talk to me and asked me what happened. I just want to check with the hive and get thoughts. I wasn’t trying to get a free dessert or anything (I declined on everything and still left 20% tip as I’ve been a server for many years) ]"

Talk about how it makes you feel finding those photos (I.e I feel insecure like you might still find this girl attractive over me, or you don’t find my body attractive…..I don’t know but express feelings) Ask him what is the story with these?Asking him “why do you still have these photos?

"[7&&green-lizard&&POST=AITA For not wanting to have sex with my partner yet?] We are both juniors in high school. I am 16, female, he just turned 17, male. We have been dating since October of 2021. I will preface with he's the nicest man I could have the pleasure of dating, and fully want to marry him. He has shared these sentiments. He is incredibly understanding and sweet. He is also quite an emotional person while I am not. There's not too much of an issue between us with that, I've learned to deal with it, but there's a certain aspect of him I worry about at times, especially now. I will not give away too much information about him here, but his home life wasn't/isn't 100% the best. It is a house of 4 brothers currently (they're all just as nice as him, they're good people), and his two parents who I can't speak too highly of. His parents have not been secretive about sexual things, even around their children (i.e. sex in the living room or in the pool, even with friends over). He's explained this to me as why he always has sex on his mind, as just a product of his environment, and I don't blame him. I'm comparably more well of than him in that area, but I understand such a predicament as I exhibit similar ""product of environment "" traits. That's not the issue but the preface. He told me that he'd wanted to have sex with me since we met (told me like 6 months in so I didn't have too much a problem with it), and occasionally we joke about it. Now, I have expressed my own thoughts on the subject- while I am not opposed to sex in our lives, I do not want to have it currently. I told him I want to wait until marriage, or until I'm 18. Now I cannot say for sure why exactly I feel this way. Perhaps it's from going to Catholic school 2nd-8th (I am agnostic now, I just theorize it's something that's been conditioned into me is all. I don't think my soul will be damned but just the non-rush aspect I suppose). Now I am still human, and I have urges. I think of him in carnal ways, normal for any human, even healthy. And we have engaged in some 'fun' when we hang out, but never gone all the way. My main reasoning is that it'd end up being one more thing for me to worry about. Whether the protection was enough, being stressed if we get caught, etc. As well as, I just simply don't want to. I'm in no rush. I have had possibly 2-3 conversations with him concerning this, and in no way does he try to convince me or insinuate force. In all honesty at first I was afraid as I thought he might only be with me for sex, but after so long I don't think it's worth it to stay with me just for that, so that's almost off the table. But those conversations also reveal that he thinks sex is an essential part of a relationship, and while I understand his reasoning I don't agree to it to where I'll do it. He's expressed that it's a bit of a blow to his feelings. I am aware of his tendency to get jealous easily, something he has to his credit gotten better with, and I believe this hurt feelings thing may be a side-symptom of it. Like it's that I don't want to have sex with him. I've tried explaining myself to him and he's expressed understanding, but a more recent conversation shows that understanding is just that- and can't really change a person's feelings about stuff. This topic has come back up recently as it's been discovered by him that his freshman brother has engaged in the act, and now worries in my own mind that he may be almost jealous of him now (in a sense). This is likely entirely contrived and I feel horrible for even thinking of it. But with this relationship, I have to take all his feelings into consideration, and this is one that seems prominent. The reason I feel terrible for the thought is that nothing in his actions have pointed to this, so it's likely a moot point anyways. I just feel as though I'm at or getting to a point where he may even being getting overly anxious for the act. Once again, no evidence, just speculative fear. I must also lay this over with it's not a crazy important aspect of my life either way- I have more important things to worry about. But as I'm having a bit of downtime, I feel some deeper thought into our relationship can keep my mind fresh. I am not relying on Reddit for answers here or for proper advice, as no one is realistically able to 100% understand us. Just talking to the void I guess.","[3&&Yusuf3690&& No, absolutely not, and never let anyone make you feel otherwise. You don't owe anyone sex, and no one is owed sex. ]"

He is not wrong for wanting sex, and believing it to be a part of a healthy relationship (for him). You two just may be incompatible. You two are still young, but you will learn that sometimes love is not enough. As someone who grew up in a religious household, I will say that you should evaluate your own feelings on the topic of sex. So much of it becomes internalized, and you need to evaluate which of those internalized feelings you want to bring with you into adulthood. You may very well come to the same conclusions that you have now, but at least you will be sure of those conclusions. ]"
"[7&&green-lizard&&POST=AITA For not wanting to have sex with my partner yet?] We are both juniors in high school. I am 16, female, he just turned 17, male. We have been dating since October of 2021. I will preface with he's the nicest man I could have the pleasure of dating, and fully want to marry him. He has shared these sentiments. He is incredibly understanding and sweet. He is also quite an emotional person while I am not. There's not too much of an issue between us with that, I've learned to deal with it, but there's a certain aspect of him I worry about at times, especially now. I will not give away too much information about him here, but his home life wasn't/isn't 100% the best. It is a house of 4 brothers currently (they're all just as nice as him, they're good people), and his two parents who I can't speak too highly of. His parents have not been secretive about sexual things, even around their children (i.e. sex in the living room or in the pool, even with friends over). He's explained this to me as why he always has sex on his mind, as just a product of his environment, and I don't blame him. I'm comparably more well of than him in that area, but I understand such a predicament as I exhibit similar ""product of environment "" traits. That's not the issue but the preface. He told me that he'd wanted to have sex with me since we met (told me like 6 months in so I didn't have too much a problem with it), and occasionally we joke about it. Now, I have expressed my own thoughts on the subject- while I am not opposed to sex in our lives, I do not want to have it currently. I told him I want to wait until marriage, or until I'm 18. Now I cannot say for sure why exactly I feel this way. Perhaps it's from going to Catholic school 2nd-8th (I am agnostic now, I just theorize it's something that's been conditioned into me is all. I don't think my soul will be damned but just the non-rush aspect I suppose). Now I am still human, and I have urges. I think of him in carnal ways, normal for any human, even healthy. And we have engaged in some 'fun' when we hang out, but never gone all the way. My main reasoning is that it'd end up being one more thing for me to worry about. Whether the protection was enough, being stressed if we get caught, etc. As well as, I just simply don't want to. I'm in no rush. I have had possibly 2-3 conversations with him concerning this, and in no way does he try to convince me or insinuate force. In all honesty at first I was afraid as I thought he might only be with me for sex, but after so long I don't think it's worth it to stay with me just for that, so that's almost off the table.

You simply can take your time, of course. If your partner does not consider your feelings on it - given his background.. (I'm surprised there are parents who just think THAT is the only driven goal when they know their kids are in relationships), then please have more conversation with him about it. If he seems ""crushed"" that you don't want to, that's something to keep in mind. You can have fun, sure, but intercourse takes time with the right person, and the right person won't have to feel upset that you want to do things the right way.

His mother was an Art Director at one of the biggest ad agencies. X and I ended up working closely together. We got along great. He was fun to work with and really competent. Not to be a jerk about it, but I was the rockstar there. But I didn't really care, I was just trying to learn stuff. This may play into what happened later.

He has a very strong prn addiction, and will literally buy, and print out prn comics he finds online. Fanfics too. I really can't tell if anything turns him off.

Lately he's been simping hard for a girl 16 years young the him (three years younger than me). I've never met her, but it's gone from having a crush to borderline obsession, and it's one of the few things he talks about (neither of us go out much). I'm so tired of him talking about a girl who's constantly in trouble with the law, and am still coming to terms with how he f'd me up mentally when I was still in kindergarten (making me almost as addicted to p*rn). His obsession with women has made it incredibly hard to come out to him as bi with a lean towards men. Him having a tendency to yell, scream, and cuss out any game that dares to not give him a perfect win has made it difficult to tolerate him for long periods of time. Not to mention that he is a purist who will go on a rant if an adaptation of a property he likes is changed in anyway even if it doesn't change the story (Domino from Deadpool being made a women of color for the movie being one of them). My mom's side of the family (which is how I'm related to him, we have different dads) is very redneck, and we believe family is family mostly (not including our drunk/druggie uncle), and he still lives with me despite our mom moving out when she left my dad, and my dad passing away.

"[1&&Zzyzx447&&POST=my older half brother] AITH for trying my best to distance my relationship with my brother? My older, half brother is thirteen years older than me, and is introduced me to roughly 50% of what I'm interested in, but I can't stand being around him for that long. He has a very strong prn addiction, and will literally buy, and print out prn comics he finds online. Fanfics too. I really can't tell if anything turns him off. As long as there are women involved, he's into it. It's caused me to show him less media because that'll just increase the amount of prn/fanfics he'll look up. Motherfcker has to have at least 20 trees worth of paper under his bed of printed prn. He showed me and my cousin (who's only a year older than me) prn when we were only 6 and 7 years old. Lately he's been simping hard for a girl 16 years young the him (three years younger than me). I've never met her, but it's gone from having a crush to borderline obsession, and it's one of the few things he talks about (neither of us go out much). I'm so tired of him talking about a girl who's constantly in trouble with the law, and am still coming to terms with how he f'd me up mentally when I was still in kindergarten (making me almost as addicted to p*rn).

You see people at work more than anyone else in your life. You can see their habits as a result. licking their fingers and interacting with other people's food while they are eating it, not washing their hands after using the restroom, etc. All of the aforementioned were done by a woman I worked with. Several colleagues who knew wouldn't eat her food at potlucks, which we frequently had. Even though I adore getting free food, I no longer go to potlucks because I felt sick from them so frequently. There's no doubt that you saw something that made you feel uneasy or concerned about eating. You can only image how it is at home if people feel that at ease doing certain things in front of other people. ]"

"[1&&Itz-_-idkwho&&POST=AITA for feeling like my bf was distant on his b-day] So a little background information my bf just turned 18 we have been in a relationship for over a year.he was having a birthday party and he invited his friends and his family was there ofc. Me and him have had a of stuff go down and because of it I hadn’t seen his parents since about maybe 5 months since. So overall I was already really nervous seeing them especially bc of his dad. So now that I’ve explained that I’d like to mention one of his friends that was coming was a girl this girl has already graduated from school and is now in college. She had to confess to my boyfriend she had liked him. Mind you my boyfriend is extremely hypocritical. if I were to have even talked to a guy as much as he talks to this girl, he would’ve freaked out let alone if the dude liked me. But besides that apparently his friend told this girl that he was having a birthday party and she kind of invited herself, but I kind of find that hard to believe. He was the one who ended up picking her up and taking her to the place where his party was. He did pick up two other people.(males) But he made it seem like he didn’t want her there in the first place, but ended up picking her up.it just didn’t really make sense to me. But anyway me being as nervous as I was I was really shaking and I went out of my way to try to go because I was already not feeling good. I felt nauseous. I didn’t eat nor have any cake but I try to stay there as long as I could and the whole time he just kept telling me to go home go home go home which is understandable right but I had told him no multiple times and I didn’t want to because I wanted to be there for him, but he kept pushing it. But as soon as I got there, he was kind of distant. He didn’t really look at me. He didn’t even wanna hold my hand. Every time I tried he would pull his hand away not to where it was so obvious, but I could feel it. as we got there his parents weren’t there yet, but it was me him and his two other friends and then that girl. he sat next to me and she sat across from us but he had gotten up and just left and I didn’t know where and everyone else left so I started walking around. He ended up going to the restroom with his friends and when he came out he saw me walking around and said why am I walking around? Why didn’t you stay at the table. So at first I didn’t say anything I just kind of let him do his thing have fun you know this his birthday I wanted him to have fun that was only the first thing that kind of bothered me. I also want point out at one point I went to the restroom because I felt like I was gonna throw up and when I went back out he was with her but I soon as she saw me she walked away. And like I’m not a mean person I’m not gonna say anything to her like if she likes him that’s fine I’m not worried about her stealing him but like why do that behind someone’s back you know? it just kind of shows me that she’s got something to hide but anyway as soon as I got home I told him how he made me feel and he got mad and said that he wasn’t doing any of that and basically told me that it wasn’t his fault I didn’t go around talking to people. And then eventually told me he’s regretting inviting me to his birthday party so I hung up because I was upset. He kept calling me back and calling me back and over and over until I answered. When I finally did he was saying something about how I guess I wanted to break up because apparently he sent me a message saying that if I don’t answer he’s going to break up with me and he’s like I know you saw it but I didn’t see it and apparently he said that I was online when I wasn’t. I wasn’t on my phone at all because I was just laying there in bed trying to stay off my phone And he just got all mad about it and I saw the messages that he sent me on everything Instagram Snapchat, my number, telling me “fucking answer” in the end he basically said that he just wanted me to tell him what he was doing wrong, but whenever I tried, he just completely shut me down and told me that he didn’t do it but he got mad when I told him I didn’t want to because he wasn’t going to agree anyway. Eventually he calm down but he kept telling me “why are you doing this to me on birthday” but I just wanted to tell him that I didn’t really feel like I belonged there and I felt left out he told me that he wanted to hang out with everybody not just me which is fine I wasn’t stopping him from that and he did hang out with me I’m not saying he didn’t He was with me, but it was just the way he was acting He hardly touched me he wouldn’t hold my hand. I just wanted to understand why the fact that he wanted to”talk to everyone” make him treat me any less of the girlfriend than I am to him it wasn’t exactly like I was pulling him away from his friends because I was with him and everybody I wasn’t trying to stop him from talking to people that wasn’t the case and around his family I can understand because it’s being respectful but around a group of friends who already know I’m his girlfriend I just didn’t really make sense to me Why he treated me differently but idk is this in my head am I the asshole?",[1&&i_suc_at_this&& Do it or I will ]

And then eventually told me he’s regretting inviting me to his birthday party so I hung up because I was upset. He kept calling me back and calling me back and over and over until I answered.

I wasn’t on my phone at all because I was just laying there in bed trying to stay off my phone And he just got all mad about it and I saw the messages that he sent me on everything Instagram Snapchat, my number, telling me “fucking answer” in the end he basically said that he just wanted me to tell him what he was doing wrong, but whenever I tried, he just completely shut me down and told me that he didn’t do it but he got mad when I told him I didn’t want to because he wasn’t going to agree anyway. Eventually he calm down but he kept telling me “why are you doing this to me on birthday” but I just wanted to tell him that I didn’t really feel like I belonged there and I felt left out he told me that he wanted to hang out with everybody not just me which is fine I wasn’t stopping him from that and he did hang out with me I’m not saying he didn’t He was with me, but it was just the way he was acting He hardly touched me he wouldn’t hold my hand.

"[1&&Itz-_-idkwho&&POST=AITA for feeling like my bf was distant on his b-day] So a little background information my bf just turned 18 we have been in a relationship for over a year.he was having a birthday party and he invited his friends and his family was there ofc. Me and him have had a of stuff go down and because of it I hadn’t seen his parents since about maybe 5 months since. So overall I was already really nervous seeing them especially bc of his dad. So now that I’ve explained that I’d like to mention one of his friends that was coming was a girl this girl has already graduated from school and is now in college. She had to confess to my boyfriend she had liked him. Mind you my boyfriend is extremely hypocritical. if I were to have even talked to a guy as much as he talks to this girl, he would’ve freaked out let alone if the dude liked me. But besides that apparently his friend told this girl that he was having a birthday party and she kind of invited herself, but I kind of find that hard to believe. He was the one who ended up picking her up and taking her to the place where his party was. He did pick up two other people.(males) But he made it seem like he didn’t want her there in the first place, but ended up picking her up.it just didn’t really make sense to me. But anyway me being as nervous as I was I was really shaking and I went out of my way to try to go because I was already not feeling good. I felt nauseous. I didn’t eat nor have any cake but I try to stay there as long as I could and the whole time he just kept telling me to go home go home go home which is understandable right but I had told him no multiple times and I didn’t want to because I wanted to be there for him, but he kept pushing it.

I had never been to places like that and it gave me some anxiety that I was doing things incorrectly, that I didn't have the right clothes, etc. My husband had been made aware of my anxieties and either shrugged them off as no big deal or assured me that my (lack of) knowledge about the menus and my wardrobe were fine. Despite the fact that I now have a solid career and make a good living, I still feel like they see me as the poor girl dating their son/brother. Overall my relationship with my now SIL was fine, but we weren't super close. At least that was my perspective. Then my husband and I got engaged. I have a sister and a handful of close girlfriends that I wanted to have as my bridesmaids. This made the bridesmaids and groomsmen counts pretty uneven and my husband needed to add more to his side. I suggested that we have his sister be a groomslady and be on his side. He originally wasn't going to ask her to be in the wedding at all. She seemed excited to be a groomslady. But once we started actually planning the wedding her tone changed. Side Note: I have never been the type of woman that dreams about her wedding. I was in grad school when we got married and felt that the entire thing was overblown and a bit inconvenient as I was focused on school at the time. My husband and I would have preferred to have a small wedding but both of our parents wanted something bigger. My family paid for most of the wedding and his dad did contribute a decent amount. As the wedding approached she became more and more difficult. She refused to tell me what she was going to wear as a groomslady (I wanted to get her some jewelry that would coordinate with the groomsmens ties - I couldn't do that without knowing the neckline of her outfit). She refused to attend my bachelorette party despite the fact that it was in the town that she lives in. She signed to play in a volleyball tournament instead of attending my bridal shower. She wouldn't commit to showing up early to get her hair and makeup done on the day of the wedding. On the day of the actual wedding she showed up less than an hour before we were supposed to leave to take pictures and asked when it was her turn to get her hair and makeup done. Her brother told her to do her own because they were working on mine and there wasn't time to do hers. In most of the pictures she has a weird look on her face, almost like she's trying not to poop. Now as I stated before, I wasn't into having the perfect wedding; I just wanted her to stop making my life so damn difficult. My husband knew how I felt and just shrugged and said things like, ""yeah, my sister is a brat"". But he did not help at all by intervening in some way. Her and I never fought about this, we never even talked about it. Now my husband and I live in a different state so we don't see her often. Because of the wedding my SIL met my best friend. They lived in the same town for a few years and developed a friendship. I knew that my friend was a bit lonely so this never seemed strange to me in any way that they would hangout.

My friend does not have enough vacation time to go on this trip and a trip with me. My husband does not seem to think that this is at all odd because my friend and my SIL ""developed a friendship independent of me"". I tried to be fine with it.

He called me back and started complaining that I didn't hear him out and he didn't think I love him because I should have put more effort on finding out who she (the earring's owner) was, what she drove, what her name was, etc. He also said it was my loss cause he was part of the 1% that didn't cheat. After being cheated on on previous relationships, I felt like I needed to go through their phone or that I wanted to question their friendship with others but I came to the conclusion that I didn't want to be that person and that if I felt like I needed to do that then is best to cut the relationship.

So it’s only been a month but something must be gnawing at you and anyone that tells you he’s part of the 1% that doesn’t cheat well I don’t know maybe I’m old but it just sounds funny. Nta.

An earring is small enough to fall off a nightstand and go unnoticed on the ""side of the bed"". Especially if its not a side you regularly use yourself. Second, it appears your previous history of being cheated on has created this hypersensitivity. If you had previously been there, and you knew the earring wasn't there previously, then you would have a beef, but this isn't the impression I've received from your OP. ]"

I recently addressed this with both of them in the last week how I’ve been the only one concerned about the floors, counters and dust. There’s also 4 cats between one roommate and I, 3 belong to me. We have 2 automatic litter boxes that I have been deep cleaning every 7 days and I also buy the food and feed all 4 cats. I asked the 1 roommate if they could clean the boxes every 4th week and they said yes and asked when it was last done, I said Friday. We had a problem with boxes in the past and I told them they need to be done every 7 days. Today, Xmas Eve, they’re gone with family and I ask when they planned to clean boxes. They said Monday. I said that I will just do it today then, because it’s unfair to the cats and can cause infection. They said “Is it bad already?” And I replied ,”it shouldn’t have to get bad, they deserve clean boxes.” Anyway, I am annoyed. I want help with wiping the counters and sweeping/mopping the floors, like once a week at least, otherwise I feel like I can’t touch the counters or walk on the floor barefoot. It’s just gross and I have been in charge of all of it. One roommate actually did show effort and I’m appreciative but the other one with a cat hasn’t cleaned anything (that I’ve noticed, I deliberately haven’t cleaned the counters since the first week of November and they are still filthy, but the other roommate has been picking up after themself considerably more and asking to help when they see me cleaning).

Have a chores schedule who cleans what and have expectations, being open with your roommates is key, but don’t be to open where y’all want to kill eachother. 2. Still have a chores schedule for everything else except the cats. I would suggest that you just clean the litter box your cats use or train ur cats to only use a certain liter box in that one area or something. If you tell ur roommate that “I am aware that I have 3 cats, and it would make sense for me to do majority of the work for the cats, but I feel that it is unfair for me to do all of it considering you have a cat as well. I would appreciate if you would be on time with the cleaning as I have been for the heath of our pets as it would be unfair for them to get sick for our tardiness to clean after them” idk something along those lines and set a schedule up.

My gf and I met in October 2021 and got together august 2022 after being friends for almost a year. I’ve always been in love with her but she wasn’t sure about being with a girl so I respected that and tried to be a good friend. During a vacation together in august she finally realized she dealt something for me as well. From there on we got together and our relationship was wonderful. We respect and uplift each other, help one another, care for each other and overall just love another very deeply. But there is a problem, she’s so insicure (due to family problems and abuse from past relationships) that she doubts everything constantly. She doubts my love for her, my loyalty (even if I’ve never ever given her any sign I might not be faithful which I am and have always been), my wanting her, thinking she’s attractive, wanting to spend time with her, … basically everything I do or don’t. She constantly thinks I lie and it’s tearing me apart. I really never lied to her! And worst of all, her insecurities make her jealous even when I talk to an acquaintance or mention a friend because, and I quote “if they make you feel good what tf are you doing with me? What need am I if you can feel positive things with others as well”. She doesn’t understand that feeling affection or happiness with other ppl doesn’t mean I don’t need/ want her(even if I’ve tried multiple times to let her know with all immaginabile love languages). And this brings us to my dog (D). He’s the sweetest and most affectionate boy out there. He’d never hurt a fly but to protect me. He has helped me through my depression and is the reason I’m still alive (which my gf knows), we have a very special bond and are pretty close. Nothing crazy, but apparently too much for her… she says I’m obsessive and exaggerated because when he comes by I pet him on the head even while she’s talking. But I really listen to her, I don’t even have to look at him because it’s just something I do to make him feel good, it doesn’t need all my attention. But for her it’s like as if I cheated every time I pet him. She even gets upset when I take him on a walk (I’ve always invited her and she went with us a couple of times but doesn’t like it that much). She keeps saying he’s gonna drive us apart but honestly, the only one trying to push us apart is her. I know it’s not her fault but her anxieties, but still it isn’t easy being yelled at at least once a day because of some made up paranoia. Don’t get me wrong I know she can’t help it and it hurts her too, but I’m getting really frustrated. I have to convince her at least once a day that I’m not going to replace her and that I do in fact really love her. But the worst part is literally begging her to believe I’m telling the truth! That really kills me. So what should I do… I know it’s not her fault, but her words and actions are really destroying me and honestly I don’t think its my fault either because I’m not doing anything but constantly showing her my feeling s for her and giving her my everything (I’ve even been talking less to my family so that she wouldn’t keep saying they’re trying to separate us). I don’t know what to do… I can’t keep on doing this… Help?","[2&&coffeelover4a&& def not TA It sounds like the relationship might be on the path to becoming toxic. If she wants you to give up the things you love that isn't right. Especially since you said she thinks your family is trying to separate you guys? That's not right that you can't talk to your family! Have a talk about setting boundaries, and see if that helps the relationship. Otherwise, you might be finding yourself resenting her for making you give up the things you love because of her own insecurities which isn't right :( ]"

He has helped me through my depression and is the reason I’m still alive (which my gf knows), we have a very special bond and are pretty close. Nothing crazy, but apparently too much for her… she says I’m obsessive and exaggerated because when he comes by I pet him on the head even while she’s talking.

She keeps saying he’s gonna drive us apart but honestly, the only one trying to push us apart is her. I know it’s not her fault but her anxieties, but still it isn’t easy being yelled at at least once a day because of some made up paranoia. Don’t get me wrong I know she can’t help it and it hurts her too, but I’m getting really frustrated. I have to convince her at least once a day that I’m not going to replace her and that I do in fact really love her. But the worst part is literally begging her to believe I’m telling the truth! That really kills me. So what should I do… I know it’s not her fault, but her words and actions are really destroying me and honestly I don’t think its my fault either because I’m not doing anything but constantly showing her my feeling s for her and giving her my everything (I’ve even been talking less to my family so that she wouldn’t keep saying they’re trying to separate us). I don’t know what to do… I can’t keep on doing this… Help?","[2&&MoetNChandon&& NTA. Sounds to me like your gf is too immature for a real relationship. Especially if she is jealous of a pet. although it may not be what your heart wants, you may have to just let this one go and just be friends, without benefits. She is not ready for this. ]"

I don’t know what to do… I can’t keep on doing this… Help?","[1&&Ants_celia&& I’m writing this comment with the thought that you’d like to stay with her, also I had the dog problem (NOT AS BAD) and the family problem with my girlfriend so I relate A BIT but, not to all. Try to have a serious conversation with her, tell her that you feel inadequate to love her as everything you have done so far, she has questioned your intentions on. You have told her and shown her, so you would like her to explain to you how she would like to be loved. In return you would like her to try to accept the love that you are showering/showing her with, you understand she has insecurities but, you love her and you want her to feel that she’s loved by you not feel questioned, it sounds draining. Your dog, if you’ve explained what your dog means to you, explain it once more and then tell her, you are an animal lover and the affection you share with your dog is not a factor in your relationship, set a boundary, you understand if she doesn’t love animals but, your dog brings you comfort and she needs to get used to you with the extension of your dog because, that’s the reason you are here. Damn, it’s not like you’re asking her to buy the dog treats just to not be defensive about an animal that you adore. If she starts shouting about the dog, tell her that your dog is not a factor in the relationship she is and how she treats the relationship with an animal that helps your mental health is important to you. Your family, bruh all family has their shit so I won’t assume yours are angelic but, you need to set a boundary regarding them, keep going to your family, do not distance yourself for her sake. Otherwise she will think this is the norm and at the end of the day your family will be missing you and link her as the problem, trust me you do not want to be defending her to your family and your family to her at the same time. She needs to understand they are why you are the person that she is inlove with, good or bad, and you would like to keep that relationship with them, she needs to respect that and support you, you need to request that she respects and supports you, only discussion should be if she wants to come along for random visits but, ofcourse I’m sure you’d like to show and share with them who you have fallen inlove with so request that she be open to going to any family event that crops up atleast. Speak about this now so she doesn’t get a chance to cut off completely. Family is important if anything were to happen, God forbid, those are the people who will be around you, explain that you chose her, you are with her, you love her and in return you would like her to not question you leaving her for them because, that’s abit insane to be honest, they are all happily living their lives and you would like to as well with her by your side and not against you. The friends, to be honest I don’t know what type of person she is but, if there is ever a chance for her to be included or to meet them even for a drink do so and tell her you are doing it so she can put her mind at ease. She can’t take you away from everything and everyone that you know that is unhealthy and then top it up with the “you don’t feel good being questioned about your intentions when you show them, are you not enough” cause, seriously, yes people have insecurities but, she can learn to accept your love. A jealous partner that exiles you from the world is never good but, if she is willing to work on this then so are you, you are willing to love her if she’s ready to start accepting it. Ps. When she starts questioning after the serious talk, ask her why she questions your intentions and tell her that she is backtracking, ask her very gently in that moment, what she would like to tell you to convince you that she is not questioning your intentions but, what she is actually unhappy about. If she comes up with zero, conversation over, you are there if she doesn’t want to be there with you, she can go into another room cause, you not leaving 🤷🏽‍♀️ Remember communicate not to start a new fight but, to resolve the current issue at hand. Small steps are still steps. ]"

"[1&&Just_Release7997&&POST=My gf hates my dog] My (20f) girlfriend (24f) hates my dog(4). A little context. I’ve adopted my dog when he was 3 months old in 2018. My gf and I met in October 2021 and got together august 2022 after being friends for almost a year. I’ve always been in love with her but she wasn’t sure about being with a girl so I respected that and tried to be a good friend. During a vacation together in august she finally realized she dealt something for me as well. From there on we got together and our relationship was wonderful. We respect and uplift each other, help one another, care for each other and overall just love another very deeply. But there is a problem, she’s so insicure (due to family problems and abuse from past relationships) that she doubts everything constantly. She doubts my love for her, my loyalty (even if I’ve never ever given her any sign I might not be faithful which I am and have always been), my wanting her, thinking she’s attractive, wanting to spend time with her, … basically everything I do or don’t. She constantly thinks I lie and it’s tearing me apart. I really never lied to her! And worst of all, her insecurities make her jealous even when I talk to an acquaintance or mention a friend because, and I quote “if they make you feel good what tf are you doing with me? What need am I if you can feel positive things with others as well”. She doesn’t understand that feeling affection or happiness with other ppl doesn’t mean I don’t need/ want her(even if I’ve tried multiple times to let her know with all immaginabile love languages). And this brings us to my dog (D). He’s the sweetest and most affectionate boy out there. He’d never hurt a fly but to protect me. He has helped me through my depression and is the reason I’m still alive (which my gf knows), we have a very special bond and are pretty close. Nothing crazy, but apparently too much for her… she says I’m obsessive and exaggerated because when he comes by I pet him on the head even while she’s talking. But I really listen to her, I don’t even have to look at him because it’s just something I do to make him feel good, it doesn’t need all my attention. But for her it’s like as if I cheated every time I pet him. She even gets upset when I take him on a walk (I’ve always invited her and she went with us a couple of times but doesn’t like it that much). She keeps saying he’s gonna drive us apart but honestly, the only one trying to push us apart is her. I know it’s not her fault but her anxieties, but still it isn’t easy being yelled at at least once a day because of some made up paranoia. Don’t get me wrong I know she can’t help it and it hurts her too, but I’m getting really frustrated. I have to convince her at least once a day that I’m not going to replace her and that I do in fact really love her. But the worst part is literally begging her to believe I’m telling the truth!

(I had it handled and even basically scared them into not trying to open my door again telling them I would retaliate to them with my husbands airsoft stuff 🤣 but hubby is super protective) Fast forward literally to now which is nine years later nephew is now getting married in a destination wedding and seems to still have some minor resentment towards my husband. so his mother my hub’s actual stepsister that is older so she didn’t live with them wants my husband to go to the wedding tho she knows we can’t afford it and she offered to pay for my husband’s trip and not me I wouldn’t really care but it is a place we have talked about going together the only person he knows is the nephew and the Stepsister and I’m uneasy about it. I should also say he has medical issues that makes him have extreme anxiety when around lots of people or unknown people and I don’t think the Step sis will be willing to leave if he needs it. I know her as well I met her at his house when he was living with his parents a lot through the years we are not close but we try to get gifts each other for Christmas. I feel sometimes she has a mild distaste for me which I get and can respect that I know I’m not everyone’s cup of tea. The whole thing tho gives me mixed feelings I feel bad that I don’t want him to go because I feel some sort of way I know is selfish cause I wanna go with hubby there someday but I also don’t want him to go alone over his mental needs and what if nephew try’s something to be mean and petty to hubby I hope he has grown up enough not to but I don’t know him enough now to know. I want to know AITH Thanks for your time","[1&&BigBeginning5052&& NTA to have your concerns BUT he’s an adult and should be able to decide for himself. If he goes, just remember it’s to try and reconnect with family. It might not even be that enjoyable of a trip. But bonus, it’s free! If you were in his shoes would you go? Or at least, would you want your spouse to allow you to make the decision for yourself? He might not go anyway. Either way, be supportive. You don’t want him to hold resentment against you down the road for missing an opportunity to reconcile with family (if it’s something he wants). Voice your concerns but try not to get jealous if goes. ]"
"YNATH it sounds like your hubby has ptsd. You could buy your own ticket , go with him, but, not attend the wedding.

If one person can post I don’t see why someone else can’t. It’s not like your private group was made specifically for your fundraiser and she tried to post it to that. Sucks that no one responded in your private chat but that’s not her fault. Maybe do a public post instead. Maybe she saw it as an okay to post about her fundraiser because someone else did theirs in the chat. We all live different lives and have different things going on.

"[3&&Pearlemtf1235&&POST=AITH for leaving my best friend after she told me I’m the reason no one wants to hang out with me?] I (17) F and my (ex) bsf (17) F, known eachother for 2 years and best friends for about a year and a half. When I first started hanging out with her friend group I met this guy, let’s call him “X”. I thought he was really cute and super funny. We started hanging out more and we just clicked. I felt like I’ve known him for years. He asked me to homecoming my sophomore year (he was a junior). And we started dating. He was the love of my life I wanted to spend every second with him and I thought about getting married one day and having kids and travel the world together. He had really bad mommy and daddy issues and I had shit metal health and would over think easily due to past relationships and family issues. About 4 months into our relationship we started fighting really bad and we eventually broke up. I quit hanging out with our friend group but me and my best friend would hang out on the weekends but I was pretty much alone during the school days. I started hanging out with the group again but I wasn’t included very much and since my break up I was still very torn apart. I would get sad a lot and just have waves of sadness and would hold in tears every time I hung out with them. But I eventually got mostly over it and started getting better. My best friend, however, hated it when I got sad. She would sometimes fight with me about it too and it didn’t make me feel any better when I went to go hang out with them. “X” eventually started talking to me again and he apologized for being a dick to me when we where together. We where friends and we both agreed we wanted to try being in a relationship again. But it didn’t work out. When my best friend invited me to go hang out with her and her current boyfriend they’d bring “X” with them and I’d be stuck in the car with all of them. This Made me feel like shit. I told my best friend I wasn’t comfortable and she argued with me about it and told me that it doesn’t matter and I need to try harder not to be so sad all the time. So I tried and apparently that wasn’t enough for her. (Also a little side note: my dog died the day before my bday this year) My birthday is always the last week of summer, and I had a party with that whole friend group and a few other of my friends. I bought snacks and I played music I made sure everyone would like, I even had my mom buy me and my friends a little pool. About 45 min to an hour later everyone had made an excuse to leave and they all just went to their other friends house to hang out there :/. so for the rest of the party it was just me and my close friend. Since my dog died the day before I was already having a shitty party and I wanted it to be fun and just forget ab it but when everyone left I just cried to my friend.. A month or so later school started up again and I’m a junior and she is a senior. Not even a week into school starting that whole friend group started hanging out without me and they would post it on their stories and talk to me about them and how much fun they where having. I confronted my best friend about it and she got mad at me telling me that it’s my fault no one wants to hang out with me and why am not invited when they hang out together. And she listed the days we hung out where I was being a downer and one was my birthday (she knew my dog died and she was even sad about it too, i would think she would understand). This made me very upset and I quit hanging out with her. A few months ago I saw her working and I went to go see her and say hi. The first thing she said to me was “haha you look like a rat” 😐. (Oh so good to see you too🤪). She asked me to take her home that night and I agreed and took this as an opportunity to talk to her about how I felt about our relationship. After she got off work I picked her up and we started talking and when it got awkward and silent I told her I missed seeing her but I feel like she doesn’t like me anymore because the only person she hangs out with is her boyfriend and the rest of her friend group and she never makes time for me. And she blamed it on her work hours. Yes I understand she works a lot but all her spare time goes to her boyfriend(when we first started being friends she told me she hates it when ppl ditch her for their s/o). I told her that I don’t wanna be friends with her friend group anymore and that if she doesn’t wanna be friends with me anymore that’s okay but she needs to make at least a little time for me and treat me like I’m not a ghost. She just sat in my car silent. We got to her house and she opened the door and grabbed her stuff and said “text me when you get home” and closed the door and left. I texted her that night and she left me on open and we didn’t talk since. “C” eventually blocked me so I just blocked everyone in that friend group and I haven’t talked to any of them since. Am I the asshole?","[2&&Mountain-Escape-1513&& NTA - sounds like your ex-friend group are a bunch of dicks. They should not have left you at your birthday party. Good friends don't do that when a friend is in pain. Also your best friend even if they're a good friend, sometimes it just doesn't work out. Been there done that. I'm still friends with mine, but after events and experiences I have way lower expectations of her. Plus, I wasted too much time with ""her"" friends. When I could have made better friendships. Take it from someone who has been there, move on. Go find your people. It's often difficult with much trial and error, but it's better than wasting your time. If you're introverted like me it's easy to cling to one person, resist urge! Cultivate relationships with many people. You might be surprised who sticks around and who doesn't. You're 17? Is university in the picture? That might also be a good chance for you to do a friend reset. Side note your instincts are also right about boyfriends. They suck a girl into a relationship and then she feels like she misses out. I'm a decade ahead of you and none of my friends are with high school boyfriends and few are even with college boyfriends. The friends that dated early also seem to carry a lot of baggage. Not saying you shouldn't date just be cautious. In the meantime while school maybe lonely try getting into new clubs to meet new people. Even if they're not your interests. Have any casual friends in class? Trying sitting with them in the cafeteria. Ask You mentioned you were having some mental health issues? Practice crafting a talent to give yourself something to care about and look forward to. It also sets you in a better place to meet friends with similar interests. Have a good relationship with your parents? Spend quality time with them. Your time with them drastically decreases when become of working age. All in all friendship break ups can be worse than a relationship break up. Mourn it but move on.

When I first started hanging out with her friend group I met this guy, let’s call him “X”. I thought he was really cute and super funny. We started hanging out more and we just clicked. I felt like I’ve known him for years. He asked me to homecoming my sophomore year (he was a junior). And we started dating. He was the love of my life I wanted to spend every second with him and I thought about getting married one day and having kids and travel the world together. He had really bad mommy and daddy issues and I had shit metal health and would over think easily due to past relationships and family issues. About 4 months into our relationship we started fighting really bad and we eventually broke up. I quit hanging out with our friend group but me and my best friend would hang out on the weekends but I was pretty much alone during the school days. I started hanging out with the group again but I wasn’t included very much and since my break up I was still very torn apart. I would get sad a lot and just have waves of sadness and would hold in tears every time I hung out with them. But I eventually got mostly over it and started getting better. My best friend, however, hated it when I got sad. She would sometimes fight with me about it too and it didn’t make me feel any better when I went to go hang out with them. “X” eventually started talking to me again and he apologized for being a dick to me when we where together. We where friends and we both agreed we wanted to try being in a relationship again. But it didn’t work out. When my best friend invited me to go hang out with her and her current boyfriend they’d bring “X” with them and I’d be stuck in the car with all of them. This Made me feel like shit. I told my best friend I wasn’t comfortable and she argued with me about it and told me that it doesn’t matter and I need to try harder not to be so sad all the time. So I tried and apparently that wasn’t enough for her. (Also a little side note: my dog died the day before my bday this year) My birthday is always the last week of summer, and I had a party with that whole friend group and a few other of my friends. I bought snacks and I played music I made sure everyone would like, I even had my mom buy me and my friends a little pool. About 45 min to an hour later everyone had made an excuse to leave and they all just went to their other friends house to hang out there :/. so for the rest of the party it was just me and my close friend. Since my dog died the day before I was already having a shitty party and I wanted it to be fun and just forget ab it but when everyone left I just cried to my friend.. A month or so later school started up again and I’m a junior and she is a senior. Not even a week into school starting that whole friend group started hanging out without me and they would post it on their stories and talk to me about them and how much fun they where having. I confronted my best friend about it and she got mad at me telling me that it’s my fault no one wants to hang out with me and why am not invited when they hang out together. And she listed the days we hung out where I was being a downer and one was my birthday (she knew my dog died and she was even sad about it too, i would think she would understand). This made me very upset and I quit hanging out with her. A few months ago I saw her working and I went to go see her and say hi. The first thing she said to me was “haha you look like a rat” 😐. (Oh so good to see you too🤪). She asked me to take her home that night and I agreed and took this as an opportunity to talk to her about how I felt about our relationship. After she got off work I picked her up and we started talking and when it got awkward and silent I told her I missed seeing her but I feel like she doesn’t like me anymore because the only person she hangs out with is her boyfriend and the rest of her friend group and she never makes time for me. And she blamed it on her work hours. Yes I understand she works a lot but all her spare time goes to her boyfriend(when we first started being friends she told me she hates it when ppl ditch her for their s/o). I told her that I don’t wanna be friends with her friend group anymore and that if she doesn’t wanna be friends with me anymore that’s okay but she needs to make at least a little time for me and treat me like I’m not a ghost. She just sat in my car silent. We got to her house and she opened the door and grabbed her stuff and said “text me when you get home” and closed the door and left. I texted her that night and she left me on open and we didn’t talk since. “C” eventually blocked me so I just blocked everyone in that friend group and I haven’t talked to any of them since. Am I the asshole?",[2&&Ortega7171&& NTA- Same thing happened to me when i was at the end of high school... i cut them out of my life... made new friends in the college... friends are there to support you in you emotional distress... if they don't they are not your friend... good luck!!! ]

Anyway, no, you're not the AH at all, perhaps you're having a rough time adjusting after so many downturns in a short period of time. I'd say move on, if that particular crowd doesn't want you to hang with them, fuck 'em. It doesn't sound like they or your BFF care much about you. You deserve much better friends, considering how they've treated you. ]"
"NTA - sounds like your ex-friend group are a bunch of dicks. They should not have left you at your birthday party. Good friends don't do that when a friend is in pain. Also your best friend even if they're a good friend, sometimes it just doesn't work out. Been there done that. I'm still friends with mine, but after events and experiences I have way lower expectations of her. Plus, I wasted too much time with ""her"" friends. When I could have made better friendships. Take it from someone who has been there, move on. Go find your people. It's often difficult with much trial and error, but it's better than wasting your time. If you're introverted like me it's easy to cling to one person, resist urge! Cultivate relationships with many people. You might be surprised who sticks around and who doesn't. You're 17? Is university in the picture? That might also be a good chance for you to do a friend reset. Side note your instincts are also right about boyfriends. They suck a girl into a relationship and then she feels like she misses out. I'm a decade ahead of you and none of my friends are with high school boyfriends and few are even with college boyfriends. The friends that dated early also seem to carry a lot of baggage. Not saying you shouldn't date just be cautious. In the meantime while school maybe lonely try getting into new clubs to meet new people. Even if they're not your interests. Have any casual friends in class? Trying sitting with them in the cafeteria. Ask You mentioned you were having some mental health issues? Practice crafting a talent to give yourself something to care about and look forward to. It also sets you in a better place to meet friends with similar interests. Have a good relationship with your parents? Spend quality time with them. Your time with them drastically decreases when become of working age. All in all friendship break ups can be worse than a relationship break up. Mourn it but move on. It'll take time, but you'll be shocked to find out how little you'll come to care about old relationships.","[2&&Pearlemtf1235&& Thank you, your words are really helpful and I’ll take that advice.

As funny as it might have been, you ruined someones birthday that you were also invited to have a good time. You’re acting more entitled than the bratty cousin.

If the dog felt attacked it was because it didin't wanted your son bothering in it's personal area. Instead of killing the poor animal you should of correct the beahavior of YOUR child. It isn't normal that a kid goes running to a relaxed animal even if the child loves it a lot, it obv that the animal will feel attacked and react badly.

Thoughts?,"[1&&justright7777&& Well I think there is a lot of ahole that should be applied to Grandma or any dog owner who has a dog that is that out of control. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs, but they are potentially dangerous animals that should be properly trained and socialized - even little toy dogs can inflict a painful bite. Any dog owner should understand that when people come to the house it can be a confusing and triggering event for the dog. If there is any doubt about how the dog will react it should be restrained or put in a crate or closed up in a separate room until things settle down. I understand your reaction, you were defending your 5 yo kid. If it were my dog, I'd like to think this situation would not have happened, but if my dog attacked a 5 yo child, I""d kill it myself. ]"

"The first part where you picked it up and slammed it on the floor was bad enough but to stomp on its neck while it was actively trying to get away from you until it was dead is absolutely horrific. You stating that ""he (the dog) must have assumed he was attacking her"" tells me that you've picked up on this behavior before and never should have let your son run in the house like that with the dog there. You could have tossed the dog into the yard. I'm sorry your son got to see that.",[1&&justright7777&& You were not there. You don't know that the dog was trying to retreat or continue the attack so don't assume you do. This situation never should have happened. There is plenty of ahole to go around.

"What you made is totally wrong, i understand that you were scared for your son life but that doesn't justify your actions. You should get professional help. If the dog felt attacked it was because it didin't wanted your son bothering in it's personal area. Instead of killing the poor animal you should of correct the beahavior of YOUR child. It isn't normal that a kid goes running to a relaxed animal even if the child loves it a lot, it obv that the animal will feel attacked and react badly. So the next time correct your son instead of killing an indefense animal and then play victim on reddit.","[1&&of_patrol_bot&& Hello, it looks like you've made a mistake.

Before you judge hear me out, I had this ex.. we’ll call him mite. I was bestfriends with mite for 3 years before we started dating and we were really close. We dated for 9 months and it was a very serious and intense relationship, and in the relationship it changed once I moved states and I left him. After we broke up I found out he cheated on me and I confronted him, got the truth and left it at that. A year later and I have a new bestfriend who I am in love with who we’ll call Michael. Me and Michael know how we feel about each other and tried dating and it lasted a month before he said he never loved me and tried to forced himself to. We are still bestfriends but he still feels upset when I mention any other love interest and then says to not let him hold me back from dating and then gets salty and dry when I try even though he knows I’m in love with him. I saw my ex peeping my story so I texted him and we talked and said what we needed and he asked why I reached out. I reached out because I was so angry with him last time we spoke and said horrible things.. I apologized and said although I was still hurt by him cheating I forgave him essentially and asked how he was doing.

He called me stupid and said he loved me but that I needed to stop putting myself in these “dangerous and stupid situations”.. it made me feel guilty and feel like shit honestly. I am very hard of myself and so I’ve been very hard on myself and he said I need to stop being so nice and forgiving and I said I guess and he said it’s for the best and that was all that was said about it. Now Michael is dry and won’t even bother to text me back until he feels like it..
