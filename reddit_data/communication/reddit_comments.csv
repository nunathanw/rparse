"[2&&Heinrich-The-Slogger&&POST=Need suggestions for speech fundamentals college course] Hi everyone, I’m pretty new to Reddit in terms of posting and I’m not even entirely sure if this is the right subreddit. I have to do a demonstrative video that is 7 minutes in length showing some type of skill or activity (ie a puzzle, card trick, etc.) I am at a complete loss as to what to do for this assignment. Any suggestions por favor.","[1&&aetr225&& They want you give instructions, and that’s actually hard to do, if never put words to something you know how to do. It’s hard to brainstorm ideas without your interests. Do you play sports, maybe there is skill you really know how to do. Maybe if you like cooking show us how. Peanut butter and Jelly sandwiches is what people always want to do, but that will not meet the time length. Ask your parents (Or someone who knows you well) on what they think you’re good at. OR Go talk with your TA or professor in their office hours. ]"

So when I had a feeling to talk about something, I had asked them to sit down on table/couch and talk. This confrontation/communication have taken lot of my energy as well. Also, Whenever I used to address them this way, they would either look into her phone, pick up calls or text someone or would say things like - “This doesn’t concern me. It is not my issue, it’s all in your mind. I have loads of other shitt to do and this is not priority”. This attitude remained constant every time I brought up any matter. I felt like I am being gaslighted. I also think, they don’t have this level of sensitivity to even understand that they’re knowingly or unknowingly gaslighting me. It was that tricky to handle this situation ! I felt like asking them couple of times “Do you know that you are gaslighting me?”. I don’t know what can of worms it would had opened if I had that conversation with them ! My conversation around them typically involved words like this - “This is what I think goes wrong with us. This is where our energies don’t match. Our likes-dislikes don’t match, our tastes are different. We don’t have much common. You should do what you like to do. I have my own goals and I only want to work on them, so probably you should look for your own place and build stuff the way you want to build. “ These were all hints that I was giving them constantly last year. I have also said “No” to every single social event that they asked me out for - which included dinners outside, movies, going to a party, travel. In last whole one year, I have not spent single social event with them outside. Even though, I really love to do all of this with friends. I felt like I am changing, I am developing trust issues, I lost my voice. I was watched every time I go out of the house or come back in, it had started feeling like a prison. I just didn’t want it to be rude on their face telling them I don’t like you, so please stop. But even saying no to all stuff above was taking energy out of me, I constantly found myself thinking how should I politely say No. On the other hand, It’s not that difficult for me to take a hint if someone around me doesn’t like me or isn’t involved in me / in the relationship I’m having with them. I don’t need to be shown/told zillion times that they aren’t interested doing stuff together. Two-three incidences are enough for me to know that they are not that much into me. In such cases, I’d usually let them go, keep distance. In few cases, keeping distance/waiting helped. People came back for good and they ended up being really good friends. This person couldn’t do that, bcz probably they can not live with an idea that someone is saying No to them. They are not getting attention or something ? I don’t know.

"[4&&_Micsi_&&POST=I believe it's not too late to change and have a healthy relationship with my boyfriend. [21F] [25M]] We have been together for almost 3 years. We live about 200 km far from each other. We are currently on a ""break"". I was only 18 when we got together. He is not my first boyfriend and i am not his first girlfriend. But he is my first love. The first person i could and i still can imagine my future with.The last one year in our relationship became toxic. We both recognized that. Neither of us wants that back. That few day break made me realise my mistakes. I couldnt COMMUNICATE. I never know how to. All i heard was ""you both need to stay and fix it on the spot"". But i was a type of person who liked being alone for a little bit after an arguement. I wanted to be alone to think about the argument and then go back and talk. He was the totally opposite. We miscommunicated so much that he just laughed when he had a problem and someone told him ""just talk to her"". I got upset about stupid things and i started stupid fights. They were totally unnecessary. I was so bad at communicating. In 2 or 3 days of not eating, not sleeping i started talking and writing SO MUCH. About my emotions, our relationship, our future. I believe we can build up a new healthy relationship.In the past i could never talk to my family about my problems. But now? I cant keep my mouth shut. He said he needs time, and i respect him. I give him the time he needs. He is trying i know. I just learned to fact that COMMUNICATION IS KEY. I am still young, this is my first adult relationship. But it's not too late. Its never too late.

It feels like you have to start from 0 when it comes to relationships. And that's how it usually is. But it's not a bad thing. You can hang out with people who are older and can present a different worldview. My advice is that you should work on yourself to be comfortable alone. It's a great thing that you go to the gym and to work. Additonally set a goal for yourself. When you're working on achieving something bigger it can give you purpose and satisfaction. It goes without saying, to read books and watch youtube vids related to communication, charisma, confidence. They provide techniques to deal with social situations.

Politics, church, animal shelter or whatever. There would be common context and also it might be easier to connect with people if you needed information or training from them.

"[5&&VacationDependent709&&POST=Divorced because of communication issues.] Hi friends, Im looking for answers/understanding after my recent divorce. I’m (42, M) left heartbroken after my wife (42, F) had left me after a 10 year relationship. During the whole relationship I noticed we communicated on different wavelengths. I could never have an extended deep and meaningful conversation with her. When I did attempt these discussions, her answers were very “textbook like” and brief. She would then get annoyed if I asked further questions or try to explore the topic. An example of this: she had expressed to me various times during the relationship she wanted children. She is very caring and nurturing and would have made a great mother. In the past 5 years of our relationship I would ask her if she wanted to try for kids as age was not on our side. Every time she would answer yes, and then I told her “ok, balls in your court, let me know when you are ready…”. She would never bring up the topic. Every 4-6 months I would have to bring up the topic again and this continued for 5 years. Another example was when I would ask “How much longer should we stay in this town? Where do you see us in 5 years time etc”. Once again she would answer very swiftly in 2-3 sentences and she made it clear she didn’t want to discuss this any further. From my perspective it was like she was incapable of having D&M conversations ( even though she considered herself as some sort of communication guru). I understand she may have checked out of the relationship long before it ended, but these communication issues were present very early on. I am just curious… is this caused by some type of personality disorder? Is there a name/label for this type of communication?",[1&&Long_Historian4573&& I just asked a similar question in another sub and got an interesting answer. They told me my partner is emotionally unavailable and probably has an avoidant attachment style. I know wery little about it so I'm not able to explain more but I thought that made a lot of sense. They also told me to run not walk cause that type of partner is not present in the relationship. Probably good to have a partner with similar communication needs/patterns. Makes things bearable. Hope you find that. ]
[3&&Loud_Commission9440&&POST=Make someone communicate healthy] Do you think you can make someone communicate healthy? By teaching by example and/or explaining?,"[1&&rizzyraech&& If this were remotely possible, I wouldn't be having to deal with an abysmally unsatisfying sex life, currently. I'm sorry to have to be the one to break it to you, but when it comes to unhealthy habits and behavior, you can't make anyone do anything they don't want to do themselves. You can't force someone to become a better person. You're much more likely to just end up causing yourself a whole bunch of headaches, stress, and despair rather than seeing any positive results if you try to fix somebody else's harmful behavior if they aren't both fully aware of your intentions, along with them being willing to put in the effort themselves to change. Now, that doesn't mean you can't help somebody cultivate healthier communication methods, or healthier social skills and behavior in general for that matter; personally, I think everyone is capable of improving themselves, no matter how extreme their lack of skills or knowledge seems to be (excluding severe cases of physical brain trauma or underdevelopment, obviously) as long as they're willing to put in the necessary work. Teaching, both by example and by description/clarification, are intrinsically essential for any novice form of learning to happen, even if you're just 'teaching yourself'. Again, this is just personal opinion, but I think the majority of social skills require at least some level of active demonstration to be fully understood simply because of their nature. You can read about how and why people interact the way they do all day long, but if you haven't socialized or learned how to communicate well for most of your life up to this point, you just simply aren't going to be fluent enough in social interactions to be skillfully adept from just reading and/or passively watching. As far as teaching/helping someone (who is presumably an adult, or at least past childhood development) who wants to learn better communication (and social) skills goes, I've honestly have found adopting resources created for children to teach them social and communication skills super effective. Like, honestly, I'm 32 years old, and I still sometimes find some of the reading material and/or activities really informative and beneficial for me. Haha! Like, idgaf if it was originally created for 5 year olds and may sound or look childish, if it helps, it helps! Why reinvent the wheel? I cannot even tell you how much time I've wasted in the past trying to find social skill material 'for adults' for simple things that I honestly just thought had be more complicated than they really are. Now, that being said, there are some things that we absolutely do a horrendous job of teaching children (the purpose of an apology, and what elements one should look for before accepting an apology, comes to mind as an overabundant example), and you might have to really dig around to find something helpful. But to be fair, when it comes to any information regarding soft skills, there's just a whole bunch of bullshit you're probably going have to wade through and critically assess; which is exactly part of the reason people with poor social skills or little social experience will need help learning if they want to improve. Hope this (excessive rambling 😂) sufficiently answers your question. ]"
[3&&Loud_Commission9440&&POST=Make someone communicate healthy] Do you think you can make someone communicate healthy? By teaching by example and/or explaining?,"[1&&Smiling_Tree&& I do. Not with everyone probably, but certainly with a lot of people. By leading by example, and when it happens, confronting them in a kind way. You can let them know what something they said does to you, how it made you feel. You can let them know how they could have gotten the same message across, in a way that wouldn't have hurt you as much, or that would make you more receptive to the actual contents of what they were trying to say. Most people that communicate in a negative way, do so full of their own emotions, and often with emotional bagage. That's the only way they were taught to communicate such emotions. And when you grow up and only ever hear that what you say is not okay, but you don't have an alternative way of conveying your message, that leaves you empty handed. So they go back to the only way they know, whether unhealthy or not. By giving helping them with how to communicate with you that works good for/with you, you help them expand their emotional vocabulary. It takes a bit of patience though, and the willingness to see beyond toxic communication styles. You'll need to start looking at intentions instead of the way it leaves their mouth, and get over yourself if they hurt you with that. And some people have been hurt or damaged too much in their lives to be able to be open to communication improvement. That's okay, you can't change the world on your own. All you can do is your part, and your best. In those cases you can practice compassion. ;) PS: Where does you question come from?

I dont understand how that is passive aggressive so if so please could someone explain Thanks","[6&&GyantSpyder&& Yes, it's passive aggressive. Passive aggression is when you have negative feelings toward someone and you don't want to talk to them about it, out of fear you will be held accountable / punished, so you express it indirectly and avoidantly in a way that still gets across that you have negative feelings, but lets you hide and/or deny your own thoughts and intentions. Being mad at someone or hurt by them and not talking to them about it, but instead crying about it in front of them so that they have to ask you about it, is passive aggressive. And then, after you're asked about it, not answering the question, but instead just expressing that you can't talk about it but it's their fault, is also passive aggressive. And then, going to some other third party in public and asking them to explain it to you because you claim to not understand what is happening is also passive aggressive - you're getting across negative emotions while setting up plausible deniability for substantive thoughts or intentions on your part. In short - you wanted to let him know how you felt, sure, but you avoided actually talking about it - what's going on, why you feel that way, etc. ""Just letting someone know how you feel"" is only a half-measure in communication. A couple of notes about passive aggression - It doesn't mean you're in the wrong in any larger sense. We have no idea what actually is going on here or why you are upset. You might be upset about it for a good reason, and you might be avoiding talking about it directly for a good reason. If you do this a lot it is probably a product of some sort of psychological history (or present issue) and something you should work through or heal from. If you are in a relationship with this person and this happens all the time there is a good chance this is not a good relationship and it should end, and that you know that already but are avoiding the truth - and avoiding the breakup is what's causing the passive aggression. Just to make this abundantly clear - if you are being abused, get out. Find a place of safety to reevaluate. It is not relevant whether you are being passive aggressive or not if the thing you are upset about and don't want to talk about is that you are being abused. Sure, feeling bad and getting across while you feel bad while denying your thoughts and intentions is passive aggression, but repeatedly making somebody feel bad and then making them feel worse when they're vulnerable is bullying, at least. The main cost of passive aggression is that it makes things more difficult. It is not inherently wrong or bad in all situations - but it's a barrier to communication and to progress - of tasks, of discussions, of intimacy, or of other stuff - it can even be an obstacle to bad stuff, which is why people get into the habit of doing it. If good things might happen it can stop them from happening, or if bad things might happen it can also stop them from happening. Someone else's passive aggression is a common source of frustration or distress, but calling you out for it isn't that meaningful in itself. Sometimes being passive aggressive is justifiable and useful, even necessary. Sometimes it's not. Hope this helps! ]"

The root of problem is even though you try all things - actively listening to their problems, giving suggestions when asked etc, you still find them crying on some thing or the other and never really implement any good practices to resolve of their problems. If they are not gonna actively work on the issues they are facing, how it’s gonna resolve the situation?

The message has to be tailored accordingly. Communication is more about the receiver than us. The first step of effective communication is to adapt your information. Try to start with the context so that the other person can easily follow and relate to the content. On providing enough details - Don't think of it as a monologue.View it as a conversation. Nobody likes to hear a ramble. So don't expect to deliver the message in one go. Instead, break down the content into smaller parts and allow the recipient to ask the questions to answer in finer detail. To be articulate - provide examples To be clear - Slow down. Take pauses.

"[5&&journeyaccount&&POST=Right way to respond in a conflict] Hi! I’m learning how to be more assertive and wise in conflicts, so wanted to ask for a second opinion on how I should have behaved in this situation. While working on the thesis I[F] accepted my friend’s invitation to hang out in the evening in a large outdoor bar. They were with several other common friends and a couple of new people. One guy, who I hadn’t known prior, had a bit of an add behavior from the start, which I could characterize as edgy “attention-seeking”. And as our vibes simply didn’t match I subconsciously didn’t go for a dialogue, chatting with others. And then he started throwing empty glasses. One wasn’t very concerning (it might have been an accident, after all), but each new one was disturbing us more and more. I think I simply side-eyed him, while trying not to pay attention. His friends asked him not to do it close to other people’s legs, while the visitors were giving us very judgmental looks. I reacted only when he took my coke can and threw it just as well: I told him off in a very “angry mother tone” and asked to take it from the ground. As he refused I continued scolding him, telling him that his behavior was unpleasant and unacceptable in groups and public spaces. After a short interaction that shown that his only motivation was “just because”, I turned back to others to continue the interrupted conversation. We simply collectively agreed not to give him any more attention. Then the waiter came and asked him to leave, unless he wanted to get escorted by security. After a bit of bickering he agreed to leave. One of my friends started provoking me along the lines “it’s your fault, you snapped just because of coke”, to which I reacted in a similar “angry mother” manner, having enough of this silliness. When we were about to leave other visitors and staff scolded us as such behavior was unacceptable in public places and told us that we had at least to clean it ourselves if we can’t make our friend do it. Reactions varied: somebody refused to clean, somebody wanted to go after him, somebody already ran away - and my friend simply started cleaning. We helped clean a bit and heavily apologized to the waiter while he was rebuking us in the most tolerant manner possible for this situation. I heard from others that the guy had mental issues (waiter: “Who doesn’t!”) and couldn’t help behaving like this, which they got used to. And it looks like that if not for the stuff’s reaction to the accident, the behavior would not have been addressed at all. Now, I’m not part of that company and do not and will not have any connection with that person ever again. Their behavior and mental state is their own business, I don’t want to judge or justify their actions. What I am concerned about is my reaction to this situation. I am very ashamed that I didn’t react to something that I felt was unacceptable from the very beginning. And that I merely snapped at him without any positive result. I also, obviously, feel guilty about the stuff and other visitors. But I also understand that I wasn’t part of that group of friends to ask him to leave or to start a bigger argument. Should I have left myself? Should I have had an on-the-spot therapy session?… What do you think should have been the best course of action to minimize the public disturbance and damage? I’m not very much of an outgoing person and rarely get into conflicts (and almost never solve them correctly), so this kind of situation is a bit new to me. Would very much understand what to do next time something like this happens. tl;dr: couldn’t stop a person in a new group of friends from causing disturbance in a public space, the group ended getting reprimanded for his actions. Want to understand what I should have done in the situation.","[2&&HungGarRaven&& I think you did the best you could in the situation and shouldn't feel bad.

"[1&&REinCoat_Records&&POST=Any changes? Any issues I am not aware of somehow? I just want to be able to communicate/ be understood better as I always mess up many things in my life (relationships especially) purely due to overspeaking or writing, but I do this to everyone. I've started thinking I need help, any ideas?] I know this is long but that's why I'm here. I'm trying to better communicate this context but I am usually quite extreme with the quantity of my words and it always breaks the dynamic I want others to consider. I tend to overdo anything I deem important amd I feel like I am wasting it's potential which hurts me, because I really have so much to say to others I care enough to put this effort in for, but I do understand why they are reluctant to do so. Any overview of my below text I could apply to all my other ""essays"" while still getting the context on point, like unnecessary points? Am I making the mistake of including controversial topics others might use to overlook the rest? Any idea why I do this impulsively? I have even done it here right now it seems. I usually have wasted too much time putting it together to try to edit such and sometimes that ends in a longer text/speech. I just have so much I want others to know, I've tried to find the answer to do this, I still don't know what to do- They were asking along the context of whether or not one can fear and trust someone. I applied some religious context for how widespread my examples impact is. Through your perception/impression of them, the one you fear (if you do not watch any your words actions around them without caution around them)- is someone you worry will do something you fear unto you, with certainty or even if it's just the chance you percieve. Therefore even if you are wrong about them, to fear them you are thereby not trusting them. Fear and Trust are counteractive to one another by their core or root nature. They cannot exist in the same aspect together, but I will say you can trust different aspects of a person while still fearing other non associated aspects of a person. You are then trusting a person to be who they are and therefore still trust them, but you will never be able to trust that person fully with your own entirety as a person. That is why trusting certain aspects of a person while replacing the aspects you fear with respect of their nature making up the whole person would be better if you truly want to love and understand them aswell as earn their trust and understanding through such. This can be transformational for the relationship as all that respect may then turn to love of or even change the very nature of those aspects into something you love rather than what you fear (respect is like a more tolerant fear by looking towards the positives of that fear), thereby potentially creating something much more beautiful a relationship than silently resenting certain aspects about them through fear. I understand a religious context may cause cynicism but I stand by this context here for it's impact on humanity, all our lives today, has done so for much of our history, and is very applicable today regarding a massive logical fallacy- If you fear God and his punishment for doing wrong and thereby do good for the purely fearful reasoning of not wanting to be punished, you will be doing so out of false morality and goodwill amd therefore are not doing good but trying to decieve that which you fear, so if God would say he loves you, as his children and as your father, and that he wants you to “trust in the Lord” and to Love the Lord, with your Freewill, we are then causing all punishments or reward unto OURSELVES and we would resent and eventually go against God if we feared him just like anything else we fear, aswell as hate ourselves knowingly or not, for acting hypocritically, not being true to Oneself. Now I'm not trying to force you to believe in God, I am only making a strong point saying that life would be alot better and more meaningful if you were to take responsibility for all your actions and never blame anyone or anything for any outcome as you always had a choice, regardless of your intention or even awareness of such, and you should forgive l and from yourself and other's mistakes or ill will even right after such should you be able in that moment. The only good reason leaders or the government (as an example) would try to suppress a population, their knowledge base, freedom, resources etc. Or why we hold secrets and information from others, is because they/we do not trust the population enough to do good simply out of being good willed, so it is evident that humans as a majority simply don't trust ourselves or others, to do good or to be truly free-willed and any mistake will look like an intentional act or fault of that person that we would hate ourselves for. Sorry for the long answer. Just thought this might help someone atleast.","[1&&misterbretski&& That's a lot to unpack. But I get it. I too am known for being long-winded.

Speaking from your own feelings is always an option in my opinion. It's hard to get mad a someone when they keep it close to themself (not: 'we can't talk about that', but 'I don't feel comfortable talking about that'). I think it's always okay to not be comfortable discussing something and expressing that when pressed to talk about it. It helps using I-messages: stating how something makes you feel. What I've noticed over the years, is that meta communication works great in a lot of conversations, especially when those conversations have underlying tension, expectations, emotions or anxiousness. By deliberately mentioning those things that are lingering under the surface, it allows you to talk about the dynamics of the conversation and change them. That way everybody in the convo or group knows where they stand, and what effect their communication will have (for example: certain topics will make someone feel excluded, or a way of saying things will make someone feel belittled) and they can choose how they want to behave. Either they choose to keep the peace, be kind and focus on the relationship - or to they can choose to knowingly provoke, aggravate or hurt their conversation partner – because they value their need to express their opinion or discuss something over your comfort or wellbeing. Which is fine - their choice - but at least their intention is clear to everyone in the conversation. It's assertive without being agressive. It can help to all feel good about the conversation, and it makes it clear when there's hidden agendas (people deliberately trying to make someone feel bad). ]"

"[2&&throwaway9376108&&POST=friend has been harder and harder to be around and is very anxiously attached] so i worked with a girl (we’ll call her jane) who overtime we became friends but not super close. we would sometimes hang out outside of work and things were okay. i tried to keep things kind of surface level because from the beginning i didn’t click with her much and tried not getting too close because she tends to be a bit of a negative nancy and talks about herself a lot. things were chill for a while and then i had to move away. my best friend also works with her and is kind of surface level friends with her as well for the same reason. over the past year, i’ve been coming back into town frequently to mainly see my BFF and sometimes go out with some other friends i met my time being there. my BFF and i would hang with jane sometimes out at the bar when i was visiting and as time has passed, she has increasingly become clingy to my BFF (and at some point told my BFF she was my replacement for her, which is kinda weird.) over the past few months that i have come up, she has come out with us and seems like her mental health is getting worse. she has admitted she has extreme anxious attachment issues and daddy issues in the past but those are starting to get progressively worse. for example she tends to mostly talk about the drama in her life constantly and goes on about it for extreme amounts (like days to weeks of complaining, which can be really exhausting to hear over and over again). i’m totally okay with people needing to vent sometimes but she just becomes a bummer to be around. on top of that, any time we are out with other friends who are male, she always talks about how those males are totally hitting on her when they’re clearly not (she gets delusional about it). more examples that i think are important to bring up about her behavior: when my BFF and i make plans with other friends or mutual coworkers and jane finds out about it, she either gets very upset she wasn’t invited to the point that she ruins the mood and is so unpleasant to be around. or if it’s plans that haven’t happened yet, she invites herself when we really don’t want her there and we end up saying yeahh sure you can come because it’s hard for us to say no when we’re put on the spot especially because she gets so upset and acts pissy (has even cried). has a very skewed view of people and gets paranoid easily so she kind of has no grey area of thinking and immediately starts judging and talking shit about people when in reality they mean no harm or creepiness. when my BFF and i need to step aside and talk privately for whatever reason, she immediately gets up and goes “i’m coming with you guys” even though there’s plenty others to hang with. she does not handle any socializing gracefully and bluntly says things that are pretty rude or talks very matter of factly like she’s right about everything. she overpowers conversations to make sure she’s heard and acts like everyone wants to hear what she has to say about herself. there’s so much more but basically, it’s a very one sided thing with jane and when when she finally asks how we’re doing, you can tell she only asks not because it’s genuine but because it’s what she’s supposed to do. she’s very forceful with her including herself in our lives and i think it stems from her never having a BFF relationship like my BFF and i have. it’s impossible to have a nice normal conversation about random things with jane. i can tell it comes from a deeply insecure place but just acts like she knows everything and like everyone needs to hear what she has to say (which is usually dumb annoying shit). i’m definitely getting to the point where i’m gonna have a sit down talk with her about her behavior but at this point i don’t want a friendship with her anymore. she’s too much and i feel like i need to walk on eggshells around her, it totally depletes my energy. i truly don’t believe she has bad intentions or is a malicious person but she has some deep issues. i’m ok with saying something but my BFF is having a hard time knowing what to do on her end because she has to see her at work everyday and hates having problems with people. BFF is also just such a nice person it’s hard for her to confront her. it’s sad because jane has no friends because of this reason but we just can’t take it anymore. i have an idea of how i’m gonna word it all to jane but would love your opinions.","[2&&thefermentress&& Candidly, people like that don’t receive feedback well regardless of how perfectly worded it is. She has trauma wounds that are not healed. It sounds hokey but it’s true. I would not spend time and precious energy trying to come up with the ideal way to convey your position. I can appreciate why she’s like that from past trauma, but that doesn’t mean you need to keep her in your life or explain why you don’t want to. Why don’t you and your BFF just make plans without letting her know and keep it simple? I don’t say this lightly btw. She needs to work on her issues to be able to have healthy interactions and it takes real introspection and work (hopefully with a great therapist involved) to get there. Not everyone is aware or willing to do the work. I have a friend that I used to go on camping trips with. We travel well, she’s not judgmental, she’s kind, etc but she’s so negative and stuck in her life. I decided after the last trip, that I just don’t want to be around that negativity. The people in our lives really do affect us and we have a choice who to allow in. While I do care about her, being around the negative nancy thing is not good for me. So now I have lunch with her maybe once a year. We are still friends, but I’ve reduced exposure. Having a BFF is a precious special blessing. We don’t just randomly connect with lots of people on deep levels all the time, so it’s important to nurture and care for that relationship when you find it. Good luck to you!! ]"

"[1&&Darkerthanblack168&&POST=I’m trying my best to make a new friend but I feel like this effort is only coming from me.] Recently, I (18F) was introduced to a guy (18M) via our shared friend. As for a little background, I’m a pretty introverted person, and I only recently decided that I want to improve myself and my communication and socializing skills. I’m trying to talk to people, I’m trying to initiate convos, and I’m trying to get involved in conversations that I usually have no interest in participating in. Now, I was introduced to this dude online. He lives in the same country as me but we’re in different cities so its long distance. I wouldn’t say that’s a problem though, since both me and him have other online friends, so none of us really have a problem making friends online. What’s bothering me though, is that he literally asks nothing about me. We’ve been friends for like, I think a week, and he doesn’t even know my name. At the beginning, I was the one who kept talking about random stuff trying to get him to open up, and thankfully, I managed to do so. But all the questions came from me. All the convo starters were from my side. He barely made any effort. No “how about you?”s or anything of the sort. I asked and he answered. Now, he sends me anime edits and all, and sometimes songs, but aside from that, it’s nothing more. I ask him if he has any plans for the future, he shares them, I give a feedback, and that’s it. I’m trying to keep myself from snapping, because I really wanna be able to make a friend by my own efforts. I don’t know if I’m being too paranoid or not, because I still don’t have much experience making friends, but I think he’s left all the communication efforts on my shoulders. And I’m getting drained. Is this normal? Should I give up on this friendship? (I wouldn’t exactly want that because besides this, he’s a very polite person who also reads a lot and seems very educated and wise, but that might just be an exterior, I’m not sure.) So should I try harder? Should I bring this up with him? Should I give up on trying to befriend him?","[1&&King-Sassafrass&& r/Relationship_Advice This is how a lot of internet relationships happen, and i mean relationships as in like, just knowing the person.

"[8&&Sad_Apple_1911&&POST=How do I communicate with my mother, she shows lacking social-emotional reciprocity] My mother is not showing reciprocity in conversations. How should I best communicate with her? I'm talking with my mother about a thing that was emotionally rough for me, but she doesn't participate in the conversation. Doesn't build onto anything I say. I'm making breaks. She is silent, isn't answering or showing any type of response. I continue to talk. She goes away mid conversation and gives me food and a gift she brought me. I tell her that I don't feel listened to if she does that and try to continue. She asks one question about something that was unclear and I respond. Then I just stop and she goes away. I get sad, and try to tell her that I got sad that she didn't answer. She doesn't try to console me. Though she says ""I didn't intend to"" when I explain it. She often things I get sad for ""weird"" reasons in communication with her or that getting sad over this means that I have problems with my feelings. This was ours ago and she hasn't come back to try to talk to me about it, seems to not acknowledge me being sad despite showing it on my face or body. It's not that she has ill intentions, she cares a lot and asks if she can do things for me. But she just doesn't understand at all. Of course, it helps me that I know that she doesn't mean anything bad but I still feel ""emotionally neglected"" - or well, it makes me sad that I tell her this and she technically ignores me. This is just one example, but it's typical for her overall approach. The tricky part is. She isn't aware of this at all, and even if I mention it carefully, meaning how it makes me feel and how the behaviour might be perceived, she gets sad and upset. She also has troubles understanding what I find difficult myself (which is often similar things as she does - I however have some self insight) and I have never felt ""seen"" or understood by her. How do I communicate with her? It also makes me question my own experience. Maybe it is wrong for me to be sad over this and so on. I know that rationally it’s normal to feel sad, but as I don’t get the response.","[1&&bonesonstones&& May I ask how old you are?

You are (most likely) not going to find the magic words to make her understand why this is bothering you. She's showing you love, but is emotionally unavailable - you're most likely not going to change that, but you can adjust your own expectations. ""Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents"" is an excellent book that can help shed some light on your dynamic. Ultimately, if she's unwilling to engage in introspective conversations and thoughts, you might have to start looking for support elsewhere. I'm really sorry your mom can't give you that, that's really hurtful. Sending you love! ]"

Communication Research, as you’ve said, entails just that. Therefore, I think that is what you should choose. Journalism is great, but it is not an academic field per se. I’d only recommend journalism to someone genuinely interested in journalism and broadcasting as their career path. In comparison, Communication has a broader application that suits a variety of fields and careers. However, you will need to tailor your studies in Communication to some extent according to your long-term goals. It is an interdisciplinary field, but focussing on only communication theory and adjacent topics might not outwardly serve your career goals if you wanted to do human resources or public relations, for example. Nonetheless, I tell students they can make their degrees work to their advantage if they know how to apply their learned skills and sell them to future employers. ]"

So, consider the audience when you write these sorts of things. Who is going to look at it, and what do they absolutely have to know? Try and summarize that in one or two sentences and then work out from there what additional details or context to add. To get started, I'd recommend writing notes the way you normally would, but then re-reading everything at the end to decide which pieces are crucial information that people won't be able to do their jobs without. Anything that doesn't meet that standard, you can get rid of. If you need the extra information for your own memory, stick it in a document that's just for you.

"[2&&WorkPantsPartyShirt&&POST=Help diagnose my problems with communicating] I am VERY frustrated at people. I cannot communicate to them no matter what I try, and I am starting to believe that I am on the autism spectrum or something. My frustrations are mostly about dealing with people in a manufacturing environment, being a manager who instructs other managers what to do and who takes orders from higher managers. The people I deal with are Estonians who are known for being closed off - which might explain some of what is happening but not everything - I think. It is becoming very hard, and I don´t know what to do - I feel like Meursault in The Stranger - it is all very surreal. I think I am mostly the one who is bad at communicating but then - how have I gotten this far... I’m hoping writing things down and thinking about them systematically helps? Maybe also I should record my interactions or something... Here are some examples of what I have seen: --- I have always thought that admitting if you have missed something or have made a mistake is a sign of strength. I realize that too easily admitting responsibility for everything is not a behaviour that commands respect, so I try to do this only when it has been my responsibility and I have missed it or have mistakenly come to a wrong conclusion and acted on that. Somehow even this is seen as weakness. Every. Single. Time. Depending on how manipulative the person is they may even try to put other things on me as a ""give a finger take a hand""-type thing. i.e., ""Maybe you also forgot to do X"" Should I be more manipulative and try to move more responsibility from myself? I’ve seen people higher up shamelessly just try things like ""Oh i didn’t know that is what I was supposed to do"" or ""I was not aware this was not taken care of by X"". Should I do that? --- I have a lot of trouble communicating information to people. It seems that people do not have time to listen to full sentences - especially compound ones. So, if I try to communicate that we - for example - fell a tree and it did not hit any houses. I can do it both ways - I think: ""We fell a tree, but the houses were not hit by the tree."" After ""We fell a tree"" I usually get interrupted with a question: Did the tree hit any houses? and the conversation may digress there because a third person may add such value as ""Falling trees are known to hit houses"" and a fourth may say ""My grandmothers’ dog was hit by a tree"" and then it is difficult to get back to that original thing that may still need some additional discussion. Or I can go ""The houses were not hit by the tree we fell."" After ""The houses were not hit -"" I can get interruptions like ""So you have not fell the tree yet."" which leads to ""When are you going to feel that tree"" and ""You should really do it. I told you to do it and you still have not done it."" (I realize as an example this may not be as good because ""I told you to do it why have you not done it"" can come from doing it later than anticipated by the person - but let’s assume this is not the case here.) So, communicating information leads to interruptions which leads to detours and diversions. I have considered the following things: I talk to fast: I try to talk slower. I talk too slow: I try to talk faster. I talk too long: I try to talk more efficiently, or I try to simplify. I´ve also tried louder and quieter - I see no effect. I´ve also tried to consider timing. I’ve tried more appropriate and (accidentally)less appropriate times to give this information. I´ve also tried to consider the context. Maybe I have communicated a lot other information and overloaded the person so they are no longer able to receive what I am trying to say. No effect in any case. When this happens, it seems to happen regardless of these variables. It seems that it could be the person I talk to or the situation (Maybe the person wants to establish that he is in control of this meeting and interrupts with pre-emptive questions) But then it often also happens outside of those things - with people why are not like that and situations where they do not have to display their strength. --- Then there is asking for information: Let’s say we need to go from A to B where A is 300km from B. It is my job to organize this and there are two people going: me and someone else. Let’s say the other person is going somewhere else after this trip and I do not know their full plans. So, to me it seems, depending on how much stuff we have we can go either by car or by bus. More luggage = car(expensive); less luggage = bus(cheaper) To decide this, I ask the other person how much luggage they have. They might ask in return (Most likely because they do not know yet): ""Why are you asking?"" I will explain the car and the bus and the luggage. They might respond to this: ""But this is for you to decide. I thought we agreed you would organizethis?"" So this is not only changing the question to something they can answer, but also changing it intosomething they can establish superiority about. Should I start doing that? The same is with updates: When I update on developments - I usually get: Help trying to solve the problem - which I don’t need. ""Why are you telling me this - you should decide for yourself."" When I do not update: ""Why was I not told?"" ""You need to communicate more."" These are some of the examples. There are more but maybe someone can help me with how to even think about these things so that I can improve.","[2&&Smiling_Tree&& Pfff, that's a lot in one post. ;) Will try to be concise in what comes to my mind... First of all: the way you described these situations – what happens, an example of a conversation, and a possible explanations for the miscommunication – is organised and easy to follow. That alone makes me think you're good at communication. I don't know Estonian culture, but I do know that in general, communication in Eastern European countries is way different than what I'm used to (being a Dutch person). I may be totally off (sorry if I am), but my impression is that it's quite indirect, you never show any emotions and there's lots of ego/saving face, often expressed in looking like you're indifferent/not bothered/not engaged. First situation: sounds like it's them, not you. Anyone breaking off your sentence after the first few words no matter where you start, is plain rude. Unless you talk incredibly slow and pretty much slur your words, I'd say it's just rude. Whether that's an big dick/small dick ego thing or something else: idk. After their interruption I'd probably pause and continue with ""if you would have let me finish..."" And then (a little slower and with emphasis) finish the sentence. Second one: if I'd be travelling with a friend, we'd both try to help, cooperate and be friendly. If the conversation would go as in your example, I'd assume there had been a previous discussion/argument about the organisation of the trip, and that there are some underlying unsolved grievances on my friends side. I'd explain my question and address that. ""I'm absolutely organising this trip, and to do so and estimate whether it's better to go by car or public transport, I need to know how much luggage you're taking. I asked, because I don't know what your plans are for after our part of the trip, and whether you'll be bringing more than I might expect. I want you to be comfortable travelling. You sound irritated that I asked, why is that? What's going on?"" Third situation: my go to option with people like that is expectation management. So telling upfront what the goal of your message is and what you do/do not need from them. ""I wanted to give you my weekly update about project X, so you are informed. All issues are being looked at as we speak and are under control. If I need your help, I will know where to find you and give you a call. So, (insert your project update)."" I hope my two cents are of any help. If not: I tried. ;) Do keep in mind: it's not always you, sometimes it's them. And in some groups, it's often them. ;) Good luck! ]"

I am a firm believer in that if everybody is being a prick, I might be the prick - which is why I find it difficult to diagnose these things and tend to assign fault on myself for maybe not communicating correctly. It is very nice when someone confirms that I am not bad at communication in general - thank You! I think what You say about Eastern European culture applies well to us as well here. I have started, in my head, calling that combination ""acting cool"". And I think I do not do that myself, because a lot of it ends up involving manipulation and being a person I do not want to be like. For all these situations I mainly try to stay polite and I try to respond in a way that also politely adresses the issue I see with communication - like you say: ""if you would have let me finish..."" etc. But these are all oversimplified examples of situations that sometimes involve complex logical fallacies on top of manipulation and ""acting cool"" and having to parse that is very difficult for me. My theory has been that it is somehow the way I act that propagates this. I think I will decide in my head that it has to be them and it has to be because it is a group where this way of acting has become a standard. Of course the fact that it is them might not ease the frustration of it still happening. Maybe there is literature about defining and handling dysfunctional communication like that in groups. ]"

Don't forget that if you have to go back often because they can't find the cause: that's not because you're exaggerating, your symptoms aren't real or you're a hypochondriac... It just means the doctor hasn't found the cause yet. If your doctor wants to stop searching because they just don't know, ask for a referral to a specialist or get a second opinion.

It was proposed to me that he would do the presentation and first of all anyone can do presentation, and one of the thing that I particularly don't like is nepotism.

Become a regular at language cafes, or make international friends at a meetup event so you can practice speaking and listening. You'll get a bigger vocabulary when you surround yourself with both formal English (books, newspapers, the news on TV) and informal English (how people talk with their friends and family). Reddit helps too! I used to read, listen and speak English semi-often, but rarely wrote in English. By actively participating on Reddit (especially in subs about something you're passionate about or know a lot of), I improved greatly. I had to look up so many words and expressions because it's easy to say things, but when you have to write it down you start questioning yourself. Or you realise you can't find the right words, so you pretty much write a whole essay to be able to express yourself (like this comment lol), only to later read other people's comments who say exactly what you meant in three sentences. Annoying, but great for learning! And it's okay to make mistakes! I'm pretty sure I make many mistakes and/or have weird ways of saying things. I had to look up 'brevity'. :) No need for shame. Shame is only for bad things you did on purpose, or for hurting other people. There's nothing to be ashamed about learning and wanting to improve and practice. It's okay not to be as fluent or good as native speakers. It's fine! :) Good luck on your learning journey! ]"

As humans, we can’t help but not communicate. It seems the issue here is that these people are interpreting your indirect communication incorrectly. Instead of indirectly communicating frustration, you’re simply tired and are indirectly communicating such (just not purposefully). However, most have become accustomed to purposeful indirect communication in which the same actions mean what they think it means. In your case, though, that’s not always true.

Every time I want to talk to someone nothing pops in my head. I do respond to people when they talk to me but it’s really hard for me to initiate. One of my good friends keeps pointing it out and even other people around me how I’m so quiet which makes me feel like more shit and inhibits me from progressing and getting better when I get no reassurance or help. It just shuts me down. It makes it hard to make friends or even have a relationship with someone im interested in.

Is there anything that helped for anybody in this situation? What can I do?","[2&&fatboulderer&& I understand what you're saying. I'm by no means a communication expert. But what works for me is start a conversation with an open as possible question and as not being a big talker yourself, nod and listen to the other person. But really listen. Get what they're saying. Ask questions about stuff they say. It's pretty easy to get some standard questions: You: Hey, how are you? Other person: Fine, you? You: Fine, where you from? Other person: From Belgium You: Oooh, how is it like there? From here the other person is going to talk bout there home. They Will most likely give you cues where you can pick up from. They could talk about thé nature, sports, events, family, whatever. Ask them about any cue they give you. Thé one you know most about is a good idea. Ask them question about those cues. People love talking about themselves, about what they've seen, reached and what they're dreams and goals are, remember this. About thé friend, i think it'd be thé best for you to Tell him/her that you don't like it they announce that you're a bit shy/silent. That you wanna work on that part of yourself and announcing stuff like that really isn't helping. A friend would understand that and change behaviour. Now failing and having An Awkward situation is a possibility, but just know that if you just ask those questions, thé more you do this and get used to it, thé easier it gets. And you get to know People and their stuff and they Will learn you about thé things they know. Important for avoiding awkwardness is be genuine and really remember what they said. As soon as thé conversation is going on and you find your topics, you'll be the one answerring their questions about you and vice versa. Don't try to look at communicating as a test, but more like a game. Search people you click with. If u wanna stay in touch with the People you talk with. Take initiative. 'wanna go for a drink?' but actually plan this moment. Don't let thé idea Bé An idea. Actually take your agenda's and look when you wanna go for a drink.

You are perfectly able to interact with others, but it does not give your strength. This is neither better nor worse than being extroverted, it's just different. Unfortunately, there are many settings, like high school and college, where extroversion is rewarded and perceived as normal, to the extent that many introverts are made to feel that something is wrong with them and that they are being inadequate. Others pick up on this feeling, it is perceived as being shy. The first step in my opinion is to become comfortable with your introversion. Once you accept it, your shyness will disappear. Either you will find that your friends are OK with you being introverted (and most likely they are) or you will find new ones. ]"

There is nothing inherently wrong with being quiet or introverted. It's important to embrace and appreciate your own unique personality traits. Feeling anxious around new people is a common experience, especially for individuals who are more introverted or have social anxiety. It's natural to feel a bit uncomfortable in unfamiliar social situations. However, having healthy relationships help you personally, socially and professionally. You should learn to overcome these anxieties. You may gradually expose yourself to new social situations, starting with small groups or one-on-one interactions. This can help you build confidence and gradually become more comfortable in social settings. Challenge negative thoughts and replace them with positive affirmations. Remind yourself that it's okay to be quiet and that you have value to contribute in your own way. When you are in social situations, focus on active listening. Show genuine interest in what others are saying and ask thoughtful questions. Being a good listener can help you feel more engaged in conversations. Seek out groups or activities. Engaging in activities you enjoy can provide a more comfortable and natural environment for social interaction. You may want to visit a local Christian church near your home to begin with. ]"

Don't think, that if only you have a problem or feel uncomfortable with something, that its not worth mentioning or doesn't make sense. I often have that problem with friends from friends or complete strangers. A first step for my opinion would be to ask questions about the conversation already going on. So don't feel pressured to tell your own story. If you don't have one, you don't have one. But you can be part of the conversation if you ask questions about what other people are talking about. I am pretty confident, that things to say will start coming to your mind, if you have made a first step into the conversation with some questions, so that you don't feel like breaking other peoples story anymore. What I experienced myself is, that if you ask questions, you get asked questions back and can start to bring up your own topic or other stories. Also don't be afraid of changing topics. What also helped me to bring conversations out of nothing is to be aware of the people and things happening around you (unfortunately only works in public). If there is nothing to say or tell from yourself, keep looking out for things happening around you and comment them, make them part of the conversation. This helped me to bring up topics by myself.

That doesn't always come off so well. To your question, in my opinion, this kind of indirectness is mostly just other people being polite. Asking questions directly, especially when it can be construed as an order or strong request, is typically seen as rude and bossy. Being indirect like that is seen as less forceful. But much of the time it depend on the relationship you have with a person. Women are the most likely to use this indirect manner of speech, my wife does all the time. But some men do as well. I have a close male friend that has a particularly hard time expressing what he wants. It's just how he is. It's worth considering though, if you just want to ""know what somebody wants of you"" that also can come off poorly, making people feel as if they are wasting your time and that you'd prefer to not interact with them. So, it can go both ways. Perhaps you could monitor how your own feelings are going for the day? Are you feeling a bit testy or irritable when you notice people doing it? Are your responses always consistent? Sometimes it's important for us to take a breath and slow down. If somebody asks, ""Are you going out today?"" that's the start of a conversation. But if you feel like they're only asking to get you to do something, to get what they want from you, that's going to color things. Imagine this. Somebody you like, but haven't had much opportunity to speak to, asks you the same thing. How will you react? Will you respond with, ""Just get to the point already."" Or will you smile and go with it? Context. We can't really change how other people do anything. Sad but true. But we can find ways to be a bit more understanding and not let it get to us too much. We're all wired a little different after all. ]"
"[8&&giorgenes&&POST=Annoyed by interrogative communication. Is it just me?] I noticed the tendency of some people to ask questions instead of directly asking what they need. For example, if the person wants you to go out and buy milk, they might ask: ""Are you going out today?"". Which raises questions like ""Why do you wanna know?"". Until the person follow up with ""If you go out I'd like some milk"". Which for me is a very annoying style of communication. I rather the person directly say ""When you get the chance can you bring some milk?"". Then I'll decide if I go out or not just for the milk. Is it just a pet peeve of mine or are you generally annoyed by this type of communication as well?","[1&&Burj-Factor6070&& I feel the same way as you, I hate it when it happens ]"
"It could be less of an indirect issue and simply a branched question. They could also potentially be thinking ""I can go out and get milk myself if needed, but my roommate/partner/friend usually goes out on Saturdays anyway and I'll see if they are planning to go out today and could save me a trip."" The first question to ask is ""are you going out today?"" And if you say no, then they know they need to go out to get their own milk if they want it that day. If you say yes, then comes the follow-up question, ""would you mind picking up some milk for me while you're out?"" Straight up asking ""Can you get me some milk the next time you go out?"" seems to put the entire responsibility on you and might imply that I'm asking you to do this thing for me the next time you go out and I have no plans to do it. Whereas in my prior example, I'm ok to change my plans and go out and get it if neither of us have plans to go out, but I'm checking to see if you are going out anyway before I ask if you wouldn't mind also saving me a trip. ""if you go out, I'd like some milk"" is not the same as ""when you get the chance, can you get some milk?""","[1&&Nohandlebarista&& Agreed, if someone asked me to get some milk when I get the chance I'd assume there's no urgency and might get it in a couple of days. But asking ""If I go out..."" communicates (at least to me) that there's some sense of ""urgency,"" like you might want to use the milk that same day. ]"

Now, I don't claim to be an expert on emotional intelligence, but what I can share with you strategies that I have done to enhance my ability to put myself in other peoples shoes. Really focus on listening to them intently when they speak to hear what they share about their goals, objectives, motives Imagine what I might do were I in their shoes. (This is not perfect, as I tend to mirror a lot of my own beliefs, but it is better than nothing) Ask people who I feel are kind of similar to that individual whom I know for their read on the other person. (It's kind of like how in the movie the silence of the Lambs - The FBI sought out Hanibal Lechter's charter to help catch another criminal.) Then I also focus on body language in the moment, and what I know of that person over time.

I wanted to share a bit about myself. There have been several experiences I've had over time that have added to my public speaking related fears and traumas. One of which, notably, was when I was a candidate for a Ms. World pageant and I froze on stage... It was disheartening because I was already in the top 3. This memory served as a a broken record replayed in my head as progressed until recently.Flash forward 7 years later or so, I felt compelled to start a local chapter of Toastmasters in my region so that I could be a part of a supportive community and also help others who have similar struggles. For those new to toastmasters, it is a club that focuses on improving your public speaking skills. Unfortunately, I had to put the club on hiatus as I pursued my Doctoral degree. Since receiving my degree, I've been wanting to dive into studying some of the fears we have associated with public speaking anxieties we face on personal levels and in the workplace. In my past experience, I would struggle with over thinking, perfectionism, and would often be crippled with self-limiting beliefs, that I truly believe debilitated me from advancing in my career.... I would also experience anxiety when communicating and presenting verbally in my corporate workplace in individual and group settings. This contributed to my feelings as if I had a lack of a true sense of my identity; all because of past traumas and feelings associated with shame and public speaking that I allowed in my headspace... One day, I realized I was tired of feeling this way and took it upon myself to allow myself to break free of these internal struggles and take action to find workable solutions for me as I aim to smash my fears. Now, I'm able to communicate confidently and authentically express myself without self-limiting reservations. I finally feel like myself and seeking to help others in ways I can that may have experience similar struggles along the way. In short, It's my hope to have a personal dialogue with individuals who may experience similar symptoms in efforts to understand certain contributors and triggers associated with the thoughts and beliefs we inadvertently have on repeat on our heads.

One comes off as defensive, and in extreme cases desperate, when they are seeking validation. You are a consultant, which means you have expertise and your client hired you for it. If they don't take your advice, so what. Don't try and explain yourself to, or worse yet convince, your client without their genuine interest and desire to understand your reasoning. This looks like the client asking you questions as opposed to sharing their opinions. A consultant is hired to tell the client what they already know, but are not confident with or because of politics can't tell their colleagues. And if that's not the case, you're an employee without benefits (aka subcontractor) so act as if they are your employer/boss. A consultant gets paid regardless of whether they agree or not, so no need to defend. A subcontractor gets paid to deliver what the employer tells you, not the other way around so no opportunity to defend. How you resolve coming off defensive in communication is by becoming confident.

Given that we mostly talk during training, the objects of complaints are usually related to dance: the choreo is lame, the costumes suck, the warming up is ridiculous- you get the idea. She doesn’t bring this up towards the group but always in one-on-one conversations. And I start to not feel comfortable with it: 9 out of 10 times I don’t agree with her (nothing wrong with constructive criticism), yet I have no clue how to tell her that. More specifically: I’d like to bring across that I don’t appreciate her attitude and I am not interested in having her dump this on me. I’m not a very confrontational person, while she’s the more dominant kind. So I’ve not yet managed to find the right words or reaction to this. How would you approach the situation? I don’t want to pick a fight nor be antagonistic in any other way. I want to get along with her well, it’s in the interest of the whole team, me included, so I don’t want this to be a thing that’s between us.

You can also express concern for her, when she complains about something you can ask if she's OK, but I think you should only do that after saying your direct statement.

"[2&&TalkToChrisMiller&&POST=A Timeless Piece of Advice] Lately I've been reflecting on the importance of intergenerational community. Here's how I've been thinking about it: Don’t get too sucked into yourself - build yourself a community. A community is several relationships that sustain you and improve the quality of your life. And a defining characteristic of your community should be that it is one with several generations. If you have business experience, help mentor a younger person getting involved in business. Connect with a retired business person and ask them questions to allow them to reflect and learn from them. This applies to any field/industry, and it doesn’t even have to be about work. It could be about life. If you’ve learned a lot through fatherhood, then be a listening ear to a young dad and provide perspective. Connect with someone who’s been a father for a while and ask them questions to learn from them. Do this in your local community. Connect with people down the street & strike up a conversation when they walk by. Connect with people at the gym and be a smiling face each time they get there. Connect with people at church. This advice is timeless. We cannot make wisdom in a lab. We cannot create leadership in a lab. We can’t create an inquisitive nature that leads to meaningful interactions in a lab. We get to be all of those things. And we get all those things by connecting with those around us.","[2&&King-Sassafrass&& What does getting sucked into yourself mean? I’m at a point where that could mean 2 seperate things. On the one hand it is isolation and hiding.

I think this is an interesting discussion to be had ]"

Another way to look at tells are to think of them as the “non-verbal messages” that they are unconsciously communicating to others. A simple way to identify some of the “tells” that you may be sending people is to record yourself during a conversation… or have someone record you. Then look back at the video and reflect on what you see. Another strategy is to ask 2-3 people who you know will be brutally honest with you this question. When you ask them, give them some suggestions of things that might count as a tell – like a change in voice, speed of voice, body position, facial expression etc. When selecting the people who will give you feedback – do you best to ask people who you believe are effective communicators who embody how you aspire to communicate with. If not, you run the risk of getting feedback from people who really have no idea what they are talking about which gets you nowhere… or even worse, can give you bad feedback that gives you a false sense of reality.

Lots of failure in the past 15 years. Here's what I've learned: It's a cultural thing. Nothing is wrong with you, it's just how people are around you where you are now. Travel and you'll see that you're normal in other cultures. There are also different cultures between professions and companies. Focus on continental Europe (particularly East) and science/engineering heavy companies. Also, laymen like trades. Most people lack the training, discipline and self-worth to be objective and not get emotional. When you come across these people, just shut up, let them talk in circles without interjecting on how they don't make sense or haven't answered your question as this makes them feel heard, and take a mental note not to engage with them in the future. It just is that way. Learn to identify these people and train yourself not to engage. ]"

So I’ve been practicing. Once we’ve established a pattern of communication with others that we see warrants change, we might want to acknowledge that to those same folks that we are actively working on changing. (They may even have valuable input that helps.) One thing I’ve said (literally) is: “I’m trying to balance my own need to be honest and authentic with the need to show grace to others.” (Switching out for similar words like “genuine” and “due courtesy” occasionally.) It’s important for me to meet this balance. So I say so, (without making it too much of a “me show” big deal.) It’s kind of a “meta-conversational” thing. From my perspective, it seems to be working out well so far. People might think I’m a little odd, but that’s probably because I am. (Comfy with that notion.) ]"

The book aims to provide valuable and useful tools and strategies for you to enhance your confidence and hone your communication and public speaking skills. My inspiration for this book originates from my own 15-year journey of developing my communication abilities. I personally struggled with a lack of confidence, introversion, and an overall aversion to being in the spotlight. However, I came to realize that despite my personal preferences and inclinations, these skills were essential for me to develop for professional … and personal reasons. This realization led me to Toastmasters, improv, and working with a coach. Now, here's my question: While I understand my own motivations and what would have been valuable and useful to me, I recognize that the reader's perspective is far more important.Therefore, I would like to ask you: What would you find valuable and useful in a book focused on public speaking, communication skills, and confidence-building for aspiring leaders?

Like, you want to come off as non aggressive but you want to state something to be objectively true, right? So the manager could be perceived to have an easier time communicating firm statements because our culture teaches us to adhere to and respect authority. In my experience this isn’t always the case. From all the jobs I’ve had, I’ve noticed that people in leadership positions must command respect from competent individuals. Those of us who are not concerned with self improvement and progressing toward life long goals will give ourselves to the powers and systems that be. But this doesn’t mean that you can’t speak you’re mind in both a passive or an assertive manner. I think it comes down to the moments we find ourselves in and who happens to hold power in these moments. It certainly changes the dynamic of things and thus how we are perceived by our peers.

I think finding that voice to effectively communicate your wants and needs has to be really beneficial.

For example, like cultural narratives that get passed down and lead people to believe that certain things should be interpreted or concluded about in a specific way? For example, if you take a person saying an ""I think"" statement, and inform people beforehand that this person is their manager or company owner, and then you repeat this scenario. But tell them this person is their co-worker or""subordinate"", then the same exact person's same actions will be perceived differently.

"I’m not sure what indirect verbal speech would be called but I’m thinking passive speech? Like, you want to come off as non aggressive but you want to state something to be objectively true, right? So the manager could be perceived to have an easier time communicating firm statements because our culture teaches us to adhere to and respect authority. In my experience this isn’t always the case. From all the jobs I’ve had, I’ve noticed that people in leadership positions must command respect from competent individuals. Those of us who are not concerned with self improvement and progressing toward life long goals will give ourselves to the powers and systems that be. But this doesn’t mean that you can’t speak you’re mind in both a passive or an assertive manner. I think it comes down to the moments we find ourselves in and who happens to hold power in these moments. It certainly changes the dynamic of things and thus how we are perceived by our peers. So back on your original comment, I think you have a good understanding of effective communication. You seem to be introspective and I believe this helps in effective communication because you are more thoughtful in your response to what the speaker is trying to communicate. I find that I have good introspection and reflection of my experiences and I’m a great listener. I have really thoughtful responses that people seem to enjoy and this has helped me a lot. I think finding that voice to effectively communicate your wants and needs has to be really beneficial. I get stuck In these notions that people are trying to dominate or bully me in conversation so I’m still trying to figure out how I can tell people how “i think” they’re being an asshole in a more appropriate work place friendly kinda way lol","[1&&Narrow_Statistician1&& I believe what you’re looking for is NVC, non-violent communication.

"[8&&JohnGodoy&&POST=How to Train yourself to Become a great leader and Communicator] Hello Redditors! An important concept I would like to share with you today is the idea of positioning. More specifically taking intentional action today to set yourself up for success in the future. If you think about it, where you are in your life today – your position - is a result of the sum of all the decisions and actions you’ve taken in the past. Therefore, it goes to reason that where you will be 5 years from now will be the result of the sum total of all the actions and decisions you take between now and then. When it comes to effective communication positioning matters as well. Whether it is preparing yourself for leadership roles, having difficult conversations, leading teams, or persuading people to buy into you, your ideas, and what you are selling… your positioning matters. Therefore, I would urge you to really consider making the decision to spend a little time every day honing your communication skills so that through the compounding of those daily actions – you will position yourself to be a confident and capable communicator in any situation you find yourself in down the line. So what to do… For starters… write every day. Whether it is in a journal or a Personal knowledge management system like Obsidian - the benefit of regular writing is that it helps you to clarify your thoughts and find holes in your thinking. When you do this long enough – it will train your brain to do the same when verbally communicating which will make you come across as much more articulate and knowledgeable… and more importantly… better at thinking and speaking quickly on your feet. The next is to intentionally seek out and have conversations with a diverse mix of people every day. When you do this, focus on asking questions and listening more than speaking. This will train you to really pay attention and be engaged. Over time, this will transform you into a great conversationalist. This is beneficial for aspiring leaders as a hallmark of running effective meetings and conducting engaging presentations is interacting with the audience…aka – having a conversation with them. In short – think-long term – and take daily action to intentionally develop your communication skills so that it positions you to be in a more confident and capable spot in the future.","[1&&mu2500&& Great advice , thanks ! ]"

"[8&&JohnGodoy&&POST=How to get better at speaking and presenting during meetings] Good morning fellow Redditors! One of the hallmarks of a great communicator is the ability to remain poised and unshaken in the face of unexpected distractions that often occur when addressing a live audience. The reality is that whenever you speak or present in a meeting, inevitably someone's phone will go off, people may interrupt to voice their opinion or challenge yours, and also it's not uncommon for people to walk in and out of the room. All of which can easily throw your focus off and cause some anxiety. Here is what to do: Build your resiliency against these distractions and the accompanying anxiety and flustering they can bring by regularly and intentionally exposing yourself to minor speaking stressors which will build up your tolerance to them. Seek out opportunities to practice in front of low-stakes live audiences where the environment is not controlled so you condition yourself to be able to work through distractions in high-stakes situations. These low-stakes situations can be at family events, volunteer opportunities, or simply to speak up during low-key team meetings. The reality is that to become a better communicator and to become more confident, you need to get the reps in. The more you practice, the more comfortable you will become, and when the inevitable stress of speaking kicks in, you will be able to rely on your training to carry you through. Becoming a competent speaker and communicator is a long-term game with potentially huge payoffs. Good-luck!

"One thing that makes me under confident during live meetings is ""not having all the. answers"" or ""not being able to think in real time"". Any practical advice on improving this?","[2&&JohnGodoy&& Hi u/Mysterious-Gold-6763, Some general practical tips to get better at both are the following: When asked a question where you need to think in real-time, buy yourself time. by pausing for a moment to avoid reacting and saying something you may not want or have not thought through, then buy yourself more time and get more information by asking a question like: ""Can you expand on that"", or ""tell me more"" Get good at writing... write a lot on your topic and expertise. And as you write, really try to keep becoming more succinct and crisp in what you write. This will train your brain to better think this way, which will in turn help you speak that way in real-time. It's a practical way of getting more effective at being able to convey your knowledge. With regards to not having all the answers - aside from just getting more knowledgeable about your topic and anticipating questions that may arise in meetings - change your mindset to not being a person with all the answers. Rather, try to become better at asking questions so the person who is epaking with you or asking you the question helps you come up with answers whether they realize it of not. Hope this helps a bit.

How can I make it naturally louder?] It can become frustrating, especially at work when I talk normally and they cannot hear me at all or barely hear me. However, when I get very angry at someone, I speak so loudly that even someone far away can hear me. A few times I rant angrily so much at someone that I end up destroying my voice for a day or two.

Learn to use your diaphragm instead. You can likely improve your clarity by hitting your consonants harder. It's also possible that you aren't distinguishing your vowels enough. Test it out by speaking with exaggerated lip movements (in a phone call or similar) and seeing if that helps. If it does, then you'll benefit from learning to get those same sounds while toning down the movements. You could also just pitch yourself up. If people still can't understand you, then you should really work on your enunciation. ]"

Everything you say is subjective: it's your opinion, voicing your feelings and giving insight in your thought process or view on a matter. And that's what a conversation partner is looking for. They're not asking for the perfect answer, objective and 100% accurate... They want to connect with you, hear what's going on in your mind and your heart, just... YOU! :) And that's a beautiful thing! Because you can't do it wrong. They can disagree with the content, but they'll appreciate you speak your mind. You mentioned being conditioned like this and coping mechanisms... That sounds like you've got a history where you were not free to just speak your mind and say things as they pop up in your head. Because they might have been used for starting an argument, to ridicule or reject you. When words (or a lack thereof) become a shield as protection against attacks and social unsafety, that shield is also blocking you from real connection and interaction with others, with love. They go hand in hand, so if you're looking for building and maintaining meaningful relationships, it's essential to start to break down that wall a little. Scary stuff, but very rewarding. Therapy will probably benefit you a lot in that regard. It can help you do that and practise in small steps. That way, you will gain confidence to lower your wall little by little and giving you other, healthy coping mechanisms for the vulnerability you will feel with less of a shield.

[0&&aallmmnn&&POST=I’m horrible at articulating myself],"[2&&JohnGodoy&& One of the most powerful ways you can develop the ability to articulate yourself is to get good at writing. To get good at writing, you need lots of practice. The good thing about writing is that it helps you to clarify and articulate your thoughts. The more that you write, the more you train your brain to create connections between the thoughts in your head when writing... and the fantastic thing is that - that transfers to your thinking.. and in turn your speaking and verbal communication. So how to get started. I would encourage you to download a personal knowledge management system like Obsidian, and then go about creating a external information bank for all your thoughts and information. It essentially amounts to being a second brain. Then, everyday, add thoughts and notes to your ""second brain"". The key here is consistency - make it a daily habit - and I guarantee you that this will help you clarify your thoughts, and better articulate yourself when the time comes. ]"

I listened hard to how they articulated themselves, looked up words I didn’t know, and re-listened to make sure I understood what was being said. Also, practice makes perfect. I hung out with articulate people and participated as often as possible in the conversations (my older brother and his friends were all obsessed with philosophy and theology and enjoyed verbose, self-aggrandizing monologues, so it was easy to find these people for me. Maybe you could try a local philosophy club or something similar?) Talk and articulate what you can, then later go over it in your head and pick apart how you could do better.

You may need to slow down your explanations - not literally speaking slower, but take a little bit more time to ""set the scene"". Once they understand the context, and have the options laid out, they should find it easier to follow along and understand what you're conveying. I think of it like story-telling. You get more engagement when you tell a story with a beginning-middle-end structure. ]"

"[2&&dilljone&&POST=Are these standard requests/changes for a paid webinars?] Hi there I was hired to give a webinar and there were many unanticipated issues. Unsure if this is standard in the field or not. First, pay was $100 to give a 1 hour webinar. I already had the powerpoint mostly put together from a prior gig so my hourly rate was estimated to be around $30-50 (1-2 hours updating ppt, and 1 hour for the webinar itself). I feel that is too low, but I am unsure what the going rate should be. The company is out of India, so I understand their rate might not be competitive compared to a US firm. Either way I refused to work more than 5 hours on this total. Second, they changed my slides prior to the presentation. They asked me to send them the powerpoint a day or two before the presentation (also very last minute). They added their logo on all slides, changed the theme completely (dark theme to their light theme with different colors and such), and got rid of my intro slide in place of their own. I really didnt feel comfortable with this as the design was intentional with my branding and it feels like they have taken my work? The webinar is recorded so I am unsure why giving them the ppt was required as well. If they wanted the logo why not ask me to place it on there? Third, they reached out about 5 hours before the presentation asking me to post on my socials and get people to register. This was literally impossible as the email request came in at 1 am my time. Not to mention that advertisement only 5 hours before the event is not effective. Regardless, I never agreed to post for them as I typically charge for a paid post on IG. I understand if they posted on their end and I shared it to my story or on twitter or something. Luckily I did have the valid excuse of ""I was asleep at 1am"", but want to know if this is normal for future webinars and should be factored into the pricing. This aspect was never communicated to me. I really couldn't find much info about these specific nuances of paid webinars. They are asking me to do recurring webinars, but I am feeling a bit conflicted right now. Anyone could give me advice? This is not my first paid webinar, but I don't have a ton of experience to know what standard going rates and norms are. Thank you for any advice!","[1&&madamejesaistout&& Whether it's the norm or not, I would find this behavior unacceptable. Are you desperate to earn every dollar?

If you pay attention to how people respond, don't take things personally when things don't go your way, and are respectful and authentic, then i think think you'll get a lot out of being here.","[1&&Willing-Apple8902&& Thank you very much!

"[2&&BCBAMomma&&POST=Anecdotal communication vs conversational narcissism vs two way conversation?] I've recently learned about both anecdotal communication and conversational narcissism and it has thrown me for a loop. I've got the conversational narcissism I think- someone who frequently talks about themselves, brings conversations back to themselves and is a poor listener. But then what's the difference between an anecdotal communicator and a two way conversation? I want people to relate to my experiences and consider that a two way conversation. And I would consider a conversation where one person talks on and on and on and the other is expected to just listen and ask the occasional question more conversational narcissism? But then why is anecdotal communication considered bad social skills? I feel like there's a nuance I am missing here.","[2&&GrannyLovesPoodles&& I’m tuning in as I have the same experience.

"[6&&Lil-Daizeyyy&&POST=How to communicate when you are terrified of hurting the other person (kinda a rant but need advice)] I’m sure there is already posts in this sub about this topic, so forgive the repeat but this is also a way for me to vent it out. My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 years. I’m newly diagnosed at 24 with ADHD, it really put a new perspective on our relationship and the issues we have struggled with since we got together. The biggest problem is our lack of communicating feelings. It goes both ways. Neither of us want to communicate the unpleasant feelings, which leaves the other guessing on what they are feeling. With how bad my overthinking is, this often just gets out of control. If things are communicated, typically the reaction of the other person isn’t great. Understandably if feelings are getting hurt, but it makes us then never want to say anything for fear of hurting each other. Example could be I’m feeling overstimulated, tired, anxious, maybe I had a long day or didn’t sleep right. He is very physically affectionate, and wants to cuddle, be near me, kiss me, etc. I don’t want him to feel rejected so I put up with it which in turn furthers my feelings of overstimulation and makes me more snippy with him. Because I’m pushing him away, he feels that he needs to overcompensate and becomes more clingy. Now I’m annoyed but neither one of us has communicated anything. Typically this will lead to an explosion of emotion, “you’re being annoying, leave me alone” and subsequently overly hurt feelings which then makes me feel even worse! It’s a terrible cycle. We are both aware of it and talked about it. It gets better for a bit but then it seems we fall back into old habits.","[1&&[deleted]&& I can imagine how this goes, I also avoid telling loves ones how I feel in fears of hurting their feelings/being a burden.. How about writing things down? Also I think the happy/sad octopus plushy thing would be a good idea, or maybe make an agreement to wear a certain t-shirt/hat/anything when not feeling alright? This does not substitute communication however, rather it would be an easy-to-use tool when verbal confrontation is too hard to do. Which brings me back to written communication, in the form of letters maybe to make it a bit fun, would be great if you could get a pack of envelops with hearts or flowers imprints!! ]"

Or is it more of “i want to word texts/emails etc.” better which is not as immediate? If it’s immediate, jot down bullet points on your phone. I pull up the sms, then type in what i want in one of those “verification code” texts from like a 5 digit number, and use that as a notepad. This is a great method and I’ve told many people on this sub this, and it’s very very effective. If it’s not immediate, and for work, do very very professionally long wording like “as well as” instead of “and”. So you have a sentence such as this: Within recent days it has came to my understanding, as well as to the attention of management that certain responsibilities and critical aspects of your employment are not being fully satisfied, which would need to become addressed. That is 1 sentence and people love the corporate bullshit that goes into it being super super long. There’s a few tricks you can use, like limiting “the” “if” and “and”. Throw in one of: “&” these bad boys and it’s very classy and ‘professional’ (whatever that means). Then if your texting with your friend in a casual text, just try to limit the use. It’s going to be hard but just replace and reword it. Maybe don’t use “and” as much and throw in something else like “oh, also” instead of “oh, and also”. A comma does fine ]"

Try honk how you can contribute to the conversation and then it won’t be so boring. You don’t have to stay on their topic. Think of some ways to gently change the topic to something that is interesting. If you are listening to someone, then find a way to say, “that’s interesting, that reminds me of XYZ. Now you change the subject to something else. You may be able to think of some better examples than that one, but you get the idea. ]"

Ask those around you when they don't get what you said, if they can reiterate what they did understand from you. You asking them what they understood may be able to help you fill in the gaps, especially if you notice a pattern. With their response, hopefully you can have an AHA moment and then explain where you lost them. This is a natural issue since we're all different, perceive things differently and then express them differently. All you need to do is understand how they perceive things and try to communicate in a way that they can be on the same level as you. Hope this helps! ]"

"[4&&relisemey&&POST=Advice needed to communicate with a passive aggressive friend] Hi there, My friend and I don't have any visible issues but every time I worked in a group with her, I did more work, felt a lot of stress and she acted like she contributed evenly. She is toxic as an individual but she's not a bad friend per day to me at least. I have a hard time with confrontation and I switched myself to another group without saying anything (I'll use the excuse that the prof did it). The issue is the prof didn't switch any one else around and I just don't want to worth with her group on this. She's seen I'm not in the group and is asking I switch back. Not sure how to deal with this, I was thinking of telling her I'm fine with the group the prof switched me into but I'm worried this will impact our friendship etc. For context I'm in a graduate program that requires A LOT of group work, I'm working w her for all the classes except for this one now. Any advise is welcome, this has been causing me more anxiety than necessary.","[2&&unimatrix_zer0&& Firstly, this person is not your friend if you can’t have an honest conversation with her about communication dynamics. This is a person you have spent time with. Spending time with someone does not automatically mean they’re your friend. Secondly, you’re not avoidant of cofrontation, you’re avoidant of getting yelled at or feeling like someone disapproves of you. It may seem like semantics, but separating the two is important in getting over the fear that if you disagree with someone then it will automatically escalate into an uncomfortable situation. Healthy communicators can talk about disagreements, even important or big issue disagreements, without yelling or attacking and without it negatively impacting your relationship with them. Going back to the first point, a friend would want to know I’d they’ve caused harm and also want to problem solve to make sure it doesn’t happen again. So what you need to figure out is if this person would ACTUALLY be upset and disrespect you if you where to be honest with them, or if you are afraid they would- again, separating the two is important. You avoiding direct communication is treating the two like they’re the same thing. The easiest way to come out the gate de-escalating is to state the issue with zero-judgement language. “Switching groups again would be too much chaos for me at this point in the project. But I would love to talk to you about group work in general. I think when we work together we have different ideas about X, Y, and Z. I want to be successful working with you in our next project so let’s figure out how to get on the same page”. And then just state the issues. Like, if you feel like she’s not carrying enough weight but she thinks she is then you two probably have different ideas about what “work” means and how labor is tallied. So just say that- “I think when we distribute tasks we have different ideas about what a workload looks like. I usually judge it by X. How do you view workload contribution?” For some people work means the hours a task takes. For other people it’s how stressful a task was. Or how importnat a task is. Once you figure what exactly the miscommunication/difference in perspective is then you can meet in the middle. Usually in situations like this it’s not that someone so wrong or right, it’s that people think different things are important. That being said, if you approach her and she immediately lashes out then just say “ok we’ll I think we’re best to be friends outside of class and not to work together in class because we have very different styles”. And then don’t actually try to be her fiend anymore but just be civil/social enough to keep the peace. I have a lot of friends I love dearly who I would never work or live with. And I’ve had coworkers and housemates who are great to live/work with but I have zero interest in socializing with. That’s all normal and fine. Not everyone needs to want to be your friend, and you don’t have to like everyone. ]"

"[1&&Lower_Citron1006&&POST=Fake Friend…?] Me: female 33 Friend: female 27 Ok. This might sound a little crazy, but I have a friend that I’ve known for a few years now. We met while we were both traveling and really hit it off, like instantly. She’s cute and fun and spunky. At the time we were both dealing with some hard issues in our lives and it felt good to have someone to talk to. Ok this is where things turn sour. It’s been a few years since we’ve seen each other once we both moved back to the states. But we often drop messages here and there over messenger. This is where it gets weird. Ive started to notice a theme with her messages. I often ask about her life but she doesn’t answer or just gives me a general answer with no detail. She often asks about me and often brings up issues I’ve had in the past. Even when I haven’t really talked about those issues being an issue for a long time. It feels as though she is almost expecting them to be an issue. As if she needs to feed off of my misery. I know this might sound a little crazy but there is also a little backstory with jealousy. When we were close while living in a different country it often seemed like she needed to compete with me with men. I was engaged to my husband who I had met there and she often would try to make him pay attention to her, not in a friend way. It was like she really needed validation. I know she’s got a rough past but is it far fetched for me to say that she could be wishing me ill. Wishing and hoping that something goes wrong with me and my marriage? My husband and I have been happily married for a few years now and her messages to me now are short and again, she just brings up major past issues that really were hard to get over. Her bringing into them up makes me feel like she’s trying to make sure I’m still stuck.","[4&&LoisLain&& What’s the question you have about this toxic, non-friend? ]"

I can relate to your pain. I used to have problems stuttering, improper modulation of my voice and a higher pitch of voice than I do now. It has taken some work to gain confidence in my voice and I can assure you it is time and effort well spent. I will link a TED Talk that I saw years ago that really helped me get started on this process and gave me some important realizations. One of the first things I learned, and this is somewhat counterintuitive, is to relax and take care of myself emotionally. The voice is a complex instrument, requiring our entire body to be relaxed and engaged. There are many techniques in which to do this but a simple one is to spend some time breathing deeply in a pattern of inhaling for a count of 4, holding your breath for a count of 7, and then releasing your breath for a count of 8. Do this for about 2-5 minutes and you will see a significant increase of relaxation in the body. You can also hum, or do ohms on the exhale which will safely engage your vocal chords and warm them up. Im happy to answer more specific questions if you have them.

Take deep breaths from your diaphragm rather than shallow breaths from your chest. This helps you maintain a steady airflow and supports a stronger voice projection. Before speaking, warm up your voice with exercises like humming, lip trills, or gentle vocal sirens. This helps relax your vocal cords and prepares them for clearer and stronger projection. Exaggerate your speech slightly when practicing, and gradually reduce the exaggeration while maintaining clarity. Strengthen your voice by practicing vocal exercises such as speaking or reading aloud. Start with simple sentences and gradually increase the complexity. Focus on projecting your voice and maintaining a steady pace. Make a conscious effort to slow down your speech pace. Pause at appropriate moments to allow your words to sink in and give your listeners time to process information. ]"

That medium evolved from a form that required as few characters as possible (3-key letters plus text rate limits). Obviously, those particular limits don't still exist, but texting is informal and brief by design, and will never follow standard communication rules. In other words, you can choose to be offended if people don't say your name in texts, but you would be unreasonable. As far as other types of communication goes, I think it might help you to understand that conversation norms are regional, generational, and even family-specific. What you were raised with might be very different from what friends and other family branches were raised with. Since you specifically mention people you care about, I would give them the benefit of the doubt that they do care about you, too, even if they don't follow your rules. At least until their behavior shows otherwise. But if they are reaching out to you and answering your calls, try not to let this one issue harm the relationship. ]"

"I think it's pretty safe to say that the communication rules you were taught in childhood cannot possibly apply to texting. That medium evolved from a form that required as few characters as possible (3-key letters plus text rate limits). Obviously, those particular limits don't still exist, but texting is informal and brief by design, and will never follow standard communication rules. In other words, you can choose to be offended if people don't say your name in texts, but you would be unreasonable. As far as other types of communication goes, I think it might help you to understand that conversation norms are regional, generational, and even family-specific. What you were raised with might be very different from what friends and other family branches were raised with. Since you specifically mention people you care about, I would give them the benefit of the doubt that they do care about you, too, even if they don't follow your rules. At least until their behavior shows otherwise. But if they are reaching out to you and answering your calls, try not to let this one issue harm the relationship.","[1&&Green-Translator8974&& I agree..

One is the ""ask"" mindset, the other is the ""tell"" mindset. That is, some people see upfront and simply ask emfor what they need etc. Others prefer hinting at it with ""telling"" signs. Directness is seen as crude, rude and mean. Problem is that these two tend to not go very well together unless both sides are aware of their tendencies. And also that the ""tells"" are only as understandable as you are to begin with. Unless someone knows you very very well, it is not a given that what you think are clear signs are understood by anyone else. As a manager you need to be aware of these differences and do your best to suss out what those thy prefer sublte tells actually mean. Some version of a kind hearted ""and what more?""type of question of behaviour where you listen to what is being said without reacting maybe. Then taking notes and thanking them for bringing this up with you, whatever it may be, then saying you will think about it/look further into it/whatever else needs doing before getting back to them in a timely manner. An hour, a day, a week, whatever is appropriate. Even if you already know how you want to reply or utilise the information you've been given. Then get back to them as promised. That gives them both space and predictability. Managing people is a skillset of its own and can be learned. As long as you are willing. There are many books about it and the best ones are usually the least tabloid sounding ones. Kind of dull but very informative. ]"

Your willingness to self-reflect and request assistance on the issue is a positive comment on your willingness to learn and modify your managerial behavior. Two suggestions. One, to change behavioral habits requires you briefly consciously and repetitively consider the issue, therefore make a list of several managerial behaviors and/or attitudes you seek to evaluate that will make you effective in your new role, grading yourself daily on your performance, and charting your performance. Don't spend more than 5 minutes per day on this e.g. time-management, patience, etc - while scoring yourself at the end of the day (or beginning of next) you can quickly reflect on interactions etc in the past work day. Choose up to 5 only and convert the total to a percentage. If you consciously do this for 3 months, you will modify areas of concern and either modify the list or discard it altogether. Second, remember you are the manager and have pastoral care over your team, which means you need to maintain a little distance, so be friendly but not a friend - a mistake some recently promoted to leadership positions can sometimes make. ]"

Here in the East, it is much older looking, more industrialized, people talk faster and Jay walk in the street (lmao don’t worry, i do it too) buildings are much much older and far more bricked. Then you go to the West and it’s more colorful, the buildings look very modern and the trees and landscapes are different.

"[2&&Practical_Fruit_8678&&POST=Why I'm to insensitive!!!] Im (f21) currently a college student in a university that I m currently enrolled in and I'm a bit of a introvert. But I had trouble expressing my real thoughs about specific topic and I would look very insensitive ( i guess I m insensitive since I had trouble reading other peoples expression) but, what I'm trying to say is that I can't seem to fit in in the stardards of the community that Im in. Maybe my upbringing is also at fault here, since I grew up very sheltered, I mean I don't even know all of my neighbors since I don't go out very often and by the way I live in the neighborhood for as long as I can remember, 21 years exactly. I usually say things that is very opposite to what I really mean, like for example, my classmates told me that it is very nice that we got to eat all meat most of the time, and that she can't eat meat because of her religion, then I told her if you think its nice to eat this things just transfer to another religion, and the surrounding became awkward.

One of the classroom sessions would be around storytelling and 'Curse of Knowledge'. Im hoping to make this an interactive session - maybe ask students to select a partner each to keep it interactive. Or perhaps something else. I just can't think of a good activity that can help demonstrate and drive the concept home. What can I do to make this a good learning experience? SOS,"[1&&Kazekt&& Challenging topic you’ve chosen. My first thought would be not realizing I’m using words other people don’t know. I think I have a tendency to analogize all concepts to something else. Have you ever heard of the game “contact”? Basically a word chooser chooses a word, and the other players must guess the word by asking questions but can only guess when the team has all shouted “contact” assuming they’ve all guessed the right word, they just can’t chat about their guesses beforehand, so it’s a bit dependent on experience, vocabulary, memory, and storytelling. Another game is “essence”, one team is guessers the other is answerers. The answerer team chooses a particular person who’s essence the answerer team is meant to represent with their answers. The guessers ask questions like “what car would they be if they were a car? What book? What landscape? Things like this until the guesser team can guess. Another would be to tell a story featuring someone who is close but not giving the name or gender of the person and having people guess who it is in relation to them. Or maybe telling a story like “being John malkovich”. I think all of these points bring home “assumptions make an ass out of you and me”. Pretty basic for recognizing bias. A fun one might be to have everyone choose a specific “special interest” and to describe a particular niche of the interest. Or take something everyone knows how to do and considers easy and have them try to do it as an “expert” would. Curse of knowledge could also be a good one for intersectional communication. Wanna make it real serious, have students role play as a perceived villain perspective of themselves, and the angel perspective of themselves. Maybe first choose a scary villain but make him or her out to be likable, don’t tell them who it is until you play the villain. I would say that anyone who understands something, understands it can’t be explained fully, and keeps it simple and humble in a way anyone could hear and feel. It also shows we harbor universes inside us and there’s limited space and time to share. ]"

My instructor does not always post the readings, and I’m taking this class before I take the intro to communication class (just the way my schedule worked out). I would like to better understand the history of persuasion theory and how it relates to modern-day communication studies. Do you have any recommendations on what I should read, listen to, or watch?","[3&&MundaneEbb9722&& *edited to hopefully fix formatting * Hey! So I’m studying persuasion theory (among other things) as a part of my CPTD exam prep. I know it’s trendy right now, but AI has really helped with synthesizing the information. It also helps to dive deeper on topics that are shallowly explained in the TdBOK (my study guide) and can help translate theories into real life examples to deepen my understanding. I’m in Talent Development so I ask for examples slanted towards my work. This topic is shallow in my book: study of how people can use messages to influence people. 2)many theories exist, Robert Cialdini’s research from the 1980’s is some of the most influential. His principles include: reciprocity, consistency, social proof, authority, liking, and scarcity. That’s it. With AI, I can dive quite a bit deeper, and while you’ll want to verify bits with a regular google search, my experience so far has been pretty good with communication and learning sciences. Here’s an example focused on my own studies, which I know are a little different than yours…. ME: Can you tell me about the history of persuasion theory CHATGPT: The history of persuasion theory can be traced back to ancient civilizations, where rhetoric and the art of persuasion were highly valued. Persuasion theory has evolved significantly over time, influenced by the work of various thinkers and disciplines. Here's an overview of the key milestones in the history of persuasion theory: Ancient Greece: The study of persuasion and rhetoric originated in ancient Greece, with prominent philosophers such as Aristotle, Plato, and Socrates. Aristotle's work, ""Rhetoric,"" is considered a foundational text in the field, as it provided a systematic approach to persuasion. He identified three modes of persuasion: ethos (credibility), pathos (emotion), and logos (logic). Roman Empire: Roman scholars, such as Cicero and Quintilian, built upon the foundations laid by the Greeks. Cicero's ""De Oratore"" and Quintilian's ""Institutio Oratoria"" contributed to the understanding of rhetoric and persuasion, emphasizing the importance of eloquence, audience adaptation, and moral character in persuasive communication. Middle Ages: During the Middle Ages, the study of rhetoric and persuasion continued within the context of religious and political discourse. St. Augustine's ""De Doctrina Christiana"" focused on the use of rhetoric to persuade and convert people to Christianity. Renaissance: The Renaissance period saw a renewed interest in classical rhetoric and the art of persuasion. Scholars like Erasmus and Vives revitalized the study of rhetoric, emphasizing the importance of education and eloquence in persuasive communication. Enlightenment: The Enlightenment period brought a more scientific approach to the study of persuasion. Philosophers like John Locke and David Hume explored the role of reason and empiricism in persuasive communication. Hume's work on emotions as a driving force in persuasion laid the groundwork for later theories on attitude change. 20th Century: The 20th century saw a significant expansion of persuasion theory, influenced by various disciplines such as psychology, sociology, and communication studies. Some key figures and theories include: Carl Hovland: Hovland's Yale Attitude Change Approach examined the factors that influence attitude change, such as the source, message, and audience. Leon Festinger: Festinger's Cognitive Dissonance Theory explored how individuals experience psychological discomfort when holding inconsistent beliefs, leading to attitude change. Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM): Developed by Richard Petty and John Cacioppo, ELM posits that persuasion occurs through two routes: the central route (based on careful evaluation of message content) and the peripheral route (based on cues unrelated to message content). Today, persuasion theory continues to evolve, incorporating insights from various fields such as neuroscience, marketing, and political science. Understanding the history of persuasion theory helps us appreciate the complexity of human communication and the factors that contribute to successful persuasion across different contexts. ME: Can you tell me about Robert Cialdini research on persuasion theory? CHATGPT: Robert Cialdini, a renowned social psychologist, is widely recognized for his research on persuasion and influence. His seminal book, ""Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion,"" published in 1984, outlines six key principles of persuasion that are based on his extensive research and observations. These principles, often referred to as Cialdini's Six Principles of Influence or Six Weapons of Influence, are: Reciprocity: People tend to feel obliged to return favors or gifts they have received. In persuasion, offering something of value (e.g., a free sample, a compliment, or assistance) can create a sense of indebtedness, making the recipient more likely to comply with a request. Commitment and Consistency: People have a strong desire to be consistent with their past actions and decisions. Once an individual makes a commitment (even a small one), they are more likely to follow through with actions that align with that commitment. This principle is often used in persuasion through techniques like ""foot-in-the-door"" and ""low-ball."" Social Proof: People tend to look to others' behavior to determine what is appropriate or acceptable in a given situation. In persuasion, providing evidence of others' approval, endorsement, or participation can make a person more likely to comply with a request or adopt a particular viewpoint. Authority: People are more likely to follow instructions or advice from someone perceived as an expert or authority figure. In persuasion, establishing credibility and demonstrating expertise can increase the likelihood of compliance. Liking: People are more likely to be persuaded by individuals they like or find attractive. Factors that contribute to liking include physical attractiveness, similarity, compliments, and cooperation. In persuasion, building rapport and establishing common ground can enhance the effectiveness of the message. Scarcity: People tend to perceive scarce resources or opportunities as more valuable. In persuasion, emphasizing the limited availability or exclusivity of a product, service, or opportunity can create a sense of urgency and increase the desire to take action. Cialdini's research on persuasion theory has had a profound impact on various fields, including marketing, sales, negotiation, and communication. Understanding and applying these principles can help individuals and organizations become more effective at influencing and persuading others. ME: Can you provide me with examples using those principles above on how I can encourage sales professionals to take a new negotiations training course? CHATGPT: Certainly! Here are examples of how you can apply Cialdini's six principles of persuasion to encourage sales professionals to take a new negotiations training course: Reciprocity: Offer a valuable resource, such as a free eBook on negotiation techniques or a complimentary one-hour webinar, to sales professionals who express interest in the course. This creates a sense of indebtedness, making them more likely to sign up for the full training course. Commitment and Consistency: Ask sales professionals to make a small commitment, like signing up for an email newsletter or attending an introductory seminar about the course. Once they have made this initial commitment, they will be more likely to follow through with enrolling in the full training course to maintain consistency in their actions. Social Proof: Share testimonials and success stories from sales professionals who have completed the negotiations training course and experienced significant improvements in their performance. Highlight the number of salespeople who have already enrolled or completed the course, emphasizing its popularity and effectiveness. Authority: Emphasize the credentials and expertise of the trainers or instructors involved in the negotiations training course, such as their years of experience, industry certifications, or successful negotiation track records. This demonstrates the authority of the course and increases its credibility. Liking: Build rapport with the sales professionals by finding common ground, such as shared experiences, goals, or interests. Personalize your communication about the training course, addressing their specific needs and concerns. This will make them more likely to enroll in the course because they like and trust you. Scarcity: Promote the course as a limited-time offer, with a deadline for enrollment or a cap on the number of participants. Emphasize the unique benefits or exclusive content that the training course provides, which may not be available elsewhere. Creating a sense of scarcity increases the perceived value of the course and motivates sales professionals to take action before the opportunity is gone. By incorporating Cialdini's principles of persuasion into your communication and marketing efforts for the negotiations training course, you can create a compelling message that encourages sales professionals to enroll and invest in their professional development. ]"

Put yourself in their shoes and imagine how they might be feeling. 3.Avoid interrupting: Let the speaker finish their thoughts before responding. Interrupting can be seen as disrespectful and may hinder the speaker's flow. 4.Summarize and reflect on what the speaker has said to ensure your understanding. Paraphrase their main points to show that you are actively listening and to clarify any potential misunderstandings 5.Show genuine care and interest in the speaker's well-being.

I'm having trouble explaining my point of view friend and she sounds so hostile when she talks like this.","[2&&MiikaMonster&& ""no one said"" - The easiest way to clear this part up is to retrace the steps, even clause-by-clause in the sentences that came before this. a question to ask in one's mind here: ""Who did the person THINK was saying this thing? Maybe they think it's too out of ordinary to believe. Maybe they are taking it out of proportion,"" followed by asking ones self: ""Did they paraphrase something that I MYSELF HAVE paraphrased, and is that why this doesn't make sense?"" Asking these questions about the unspoken parts of conversation is essential, and asking to make sure what someone was saying is always the most direct way to clear things up. Direct does not mean easy. Many people see directness as a sign of rudeness. IMHO, assuming things that make you then angry is even ruder in a conversation. It leaves no room for onward movement. - Saying that ""no one says"" anything is what has been coined as a ""thought-terminating cliché."" Things like ""It is what it is,"" and ""Them's the breaks,"" and ""I could never _."" All of these are trite phrases that people copy and paste into their own spoken dialogues when they don't see a way out of the conversation without either going too in-depth or risking having a ""wrong"" answer. Sometimes there is no right answer to the situation. Saying out loud ""Wow, there's no right answer to this, is there?"" is much more powerful and vulnerable than just saying ""No one said that,"" or ""You're wrong but ok,"" or ""Wow that sucks."" Nobody is happy with those last 3 options, even the person saying them. ""No one said _,"" --> ""But you JUST SAID _!!!"" is often how a negative-feeling interaction goes. Instead of this, perhaps rephrasing it along these lines may help: ""No one said ___."" -->""Okay. It really seemed that way from how you said it. I'm confused then, how did I hear ___ when that wasn't the case?"" Taking the initiative to ask if you got something right is courageous. Admitting to your mistakes is courageous. Do it as often as needed. Showing the person that you are confused is important, it allows people to hear and see that you are not committed to being RIGHT in the conversation, but committed to being HEARD and hearing others. This is highly valuable. Why hang out with someone who constantly thinks he knows everything and is an asshole about it when you could hang out with someone constantly confused about the world but happy and satisfied when he learns something new? - Saying out loud that you are confused by what YOU heard is far less accusatory than asking what the OTHER person meant. Even if you found out you heard something more accurate. Even if you find out you were right all along. EVEN IF. Because it takes the WHOLE conversation to find these things out, and other participators arrive to conclusions in different ways at different times. Thought terminating cliché's stop the speakers' abilities to come to conclusions through different paths before they can even start. Wiggle out of those traps at all costs. - Anywhere in communication where SHOULD appears, there is an ASSUMPTION. Mistaken assumptions happen often, and one of the big words that people use frequently when they assume is ""should"". We MUST MAKE SURE FIRST that people are on the same page of certain assumptions before we move forward into further conversation. In concrete reality, we all must assume things to certain degrees, even and especially scientists. Statistics, n-numbers, and percentages of likeliness are all assumptions informed by intense research, experimentation, and practice. We live on the mountains of data being used in assumptive ways. Assumptions are not negative or positive, simply a shortcut towards a concept. In conversation, agreeing the sky is blue lets us then talk about other features of the sky. Agreeing one person knows an idea lets us then talk about how that idea relates to other things. Being in an argument where the goal is to agree if one person actually knows something/is correct......... we have tests, exams, practicums, and officiated trials of merit for that. If someone is constantly testing you or you feel constantly tested in casual conversation, outside of those types of situations, you are having circular conversations. It is exhausting. You do not have to prove or defend yourself 24/7. - Saying ""No one said _."" is an assumption. How could this person possibly know what everyone has said and tracked it so tightly? Even in the conversation. Speaking for other people is rude. It also dismisses you if it is directly something you were trying to articulate, or something said previously. This is one of the steps in the gaslighting dance. ]"

I hope it is helpful! Yes, these are issues. And yes, they bring a reaction in me as well. I'm sorry you feel triggered by them, if there is a way you can buffer your trigger response it will allow you to be engaged while still feeling upset, which is much better than being too upset to engage at all. This is a ""normal"" communication maneuver by English speakers and by many European language speakers, as well as in many more international countries. I can only speak to American English conversations here. I have a BA in Comm focused in Audiovisual Media, have had a counselor for over 5 years, and have been in many many many awful conversations that I wish went differently. These kind of tactics are used as a deflective conversational tool when someone's character is attacked. A character attack is called ""ad hominem"" in rhetorical schools, and shifts the focus of the conversation to dragging the identity of the speaker through the mud instead of staying on the content. The kind of stuff you mentioned is the micro-scale of that dynamic. ""ad hominem"" is a direct attack on character, and these snippets you've quoted are the responses of someone who feels their character under threat. Steering the conversation away from questioning someone's character or insight and instead towards the information being discussed is the best way to avoid traps like this, but sometimes the other person is the one making the trap. Then.... you have to figure out which way they respond to each phrase of yours, and pick phrases that built the train of conversation to where you want smoothly, rather than skipping over data (making an assumption) to get to the point too quickly. People often use this language so they do not have to say the actual thing out loud, because it either takes too much time, mental capacity, emotional capacity, or dedication about the subject. Much of the time it is these things, and not an actual inability to have dialogue and express things. The stress comes from outside and the mind starts prioritizing. Often conversational clarity is at the lower end of the list compared to job, money, food, housing, and family. This sucks. It sucks!!!! One must also use their imagination and experiences here. People have been abused to the point of not revealing parts of themselves and to the person abused the consequence of a negative conversation might be preferable or easier to deal with than the abuse they may be expecting from being honest. This is ridiculously, sadly, frustratingly, and absurdly common. When someone is abused, they often do the same to others, since it is the deepest ingrained rule-set they have for interacting socially. It means they need just as much help as anyone they abuse, often more if the goal is to help them not continue to be abusive. ]"

Learn about it in-depth. It is an art. Many subsets of language and communication are heavily based in implications before any face-to-face dialogue happens.

Avoid using language that boxes both of you in an ad hominem cycle. Aim for language that admits things. - Paraphrasing leaves room for ambiguity and releases responsibility from the speaker, but it has its own hidden responsibility: the speaker chose to say things their own way. THAT is a crossroads to look at more closely. The speaker made a choice to either repeat the information, to say they are imperfect at remembering/repeating but repeat it anyway, paraphrase, not tell the whole thing, or lie.

Asking why one choice over another was made during paraphrasing can help you figure out more clearly what is going on. - If ""it was never implied,"" then asking someone ""Oh, okay.

This has had an effect on people to filter out a lot of things. After all, media at the end of the day can be regarded as spam by someone. I sadly don’t have any articles or books off the top of my head that i can give reference to what it is you are asking, however in a world where everything is more connected, advertisements, marketing and propaganda have to really try to step hard to make something on people’s minds. From Shopify Get-Rich-Quick schemes, to phrases like “Astroturfing” and “sock puppets”. The media has been quite scarily been trying it’s hardest on another generation. The greatest marketing social campaign i have seen in the digital age is Pokémon Go. And this phenomenon highlighted a lot of points that connected just right. You take a nostalgic brand Pokémon, every kid from 1990’s forward You make it a game BUT! It is what kind of game that matters. This one was a test of ‘Augmented Reality’ where you use your camera to see something on the screen, as if real life with you Then, you advertise Advertising as history has seen it is usually billboards, tv commercials, ad placements whatever. What had made Pokémon Go’s advertising so god tier for our era, was that it wasn’t just getting people to view it, it was getting people to walk through your door. Very scary stuff. So imagine someone saying “i will pay you $50 if you put a Pokémon at MY restaurant where people HAVE to come to in order to get.” How to manage the health of the campaign, is quite literally who walked through your door. You cannot unview this or scroll past it. This was an action people had to take to not just click or whatever, but to actually show up, and exist, and buy your food or product or whatever. Then you get into video games with loot boxes, essentially a slot machine for kids (colorful lights, interactive, randomized outputs. It’s gambling addictions gone unregulated).

When noise occurs, it distracts the receiver of the message from the subject or the content of the message. It creates a barrier and communication and whatever message was trying to be sent is ineffective. And instead the receiver of the message focus on the noise. This can disrupt the communication process and create unintended outcomes. There's different kinds of something noises: physical noise (environmental factors like something playing in the background that's too loud), physiological noise (being too sleepy to focus or too hungry to listen), psychological noise (something that happens within your mind, like perhaps you're anxious or you're angry). In your situation, this was the case of semantic noise. The word choice of the sender accidentally offended the receiver. It happens, and when it happens it needs to be clarified and fixed. But if you wanted to get deeper into it, there are different communication theories that deal with miscommunication that occurs in intercultural communication.

"[6&&SavorySour&&POST=How to deal with negative feelings while conveying a message ?] Hi there I am new. I had to learn how to properly communicate forced by life 🙃 I have an history of trauma and I am conscious of my triggers most of the time. I find it utterly difficult to stand up for myself or my beliefs without either being a doormat or being aggressive. I am looking for literature,tips or videos that cover that subject. The pain lies in the amount of feelings I feel during a dialog which end up freezing my brain and, therefore,not making my point. Plus I am an expat, so not talking in my mother's tongue makes it extra difficult. For example yesterday my husband gifted me a very expensive gold chain. I find it ugly. I thanked him because the gesture is incredibly sweet and caring, even the reason why he did it made me extremely grateful to be with him. But still, my God, it's nothing for me. So I even feel offended that he didn't listened when I said ""I never wear gold"" but of course I immediately feel guilty of even just thinking it thus I shut my mouth and wear it. I noticed I do that a lot, therefore letting people think I am a different person not to hurt their feelings. I know it's very dysfunctional, I am working on it real hard even,I communicated with my husband and told him that I valued his present a lot, but do not like the look of it and that no matter what I'll keep it if it can't be exchanged because it means something to me.

First, a common misconception about communication. A lot of people think that not communicating sufficiently, especially in a relationship, means not expressing yourself effectively. This is only half of it - it also involves not listening effectively, and, most challengingly, not combining expressing and listening - being responded to, feeling responded to, and understanding how someone responds to you. The hardest and maybe most important part of communicating with a loved one is expressing yourself to them and then listening and responding to what they actually say, rather than what you imagine they might say. When we don't have sufficient information to understand a scenario, our minds will usually take what we do have and use it to fill the gaps - extrapolating out any patterns to try to make sense of it, often without our self-awareness. If you are not communicating effectively, not only are you not being heard, but you are not getting enough information to understand what is really going on. For example - OP you say in your post, it seems, that you have some anxiety, which is totally normal especially if you've been through some stuff, and that this makes it hard for you to express your true feelings about situations to people. That's very normal! Makes a lot of sense! However, you also later ask how you can ""deliver my truth without hurting anyone."" You're not hurting anyone else. The pain you are feeling is your pain, not theirs. Even if telling people how you feel were to hurt people, you would have no way of knowing, because you haven't been talking to them, and because of that you have had no opportunity to listen to them responding. You seem to be imagining how other people might feel were you to talk to them - you are filling in missing information about other people by projecting your own feelings onto them. This is a common psychological defense mechanism and it is not at all surprising that you're in that habit. You do not need to hijack yourself. You need to feel worthy of your feelings. Your either feeling like a doormat or too aggressive likely comes from a lack of worthiness and safety around it - deep down you don't believe your feelings matter, so that's how you assume others will treat you, and that's the situations you create. Your husband might be a bit of a doofus because he forgot what kind of jewelry you like, or maybe he also has issues listening and communicating, but nothing in here suggests that he would actually be as bothered by you talking to him about the gift as you imagine you would be. Remember trauma leads to black-and-white thinking. It skews our perspective. It gives us a sense of how situations might be that is not based in fact. Now, of course, this is a tricky situation even without this additional obstacle - it is rude to tell people you don't like their gifts - a person might include a gift receipt so you can return it without having to tell them as a courtesy. But this is a sentimental gift of jewelry from your spouse, that is not typically that kind of situation. But you can talk to him about it, and it won't necessarily hurt his feelings if you just tell him the truth. It is very common for couples to shop for jewelry together, and it is a very hard thing to buy jewelry for someone without getting input about what they like. It sounds like you and your husband aren't very communicative with each other, so he tried and missed the mark. Could you possibly go to him and say, ""I love so much that you got me a necklace. It was such a sweet gift. And I was embarrassed and didn't want to tell you, but I would have loved to have picked this out with you together, rather than just have you pick it out for me. That way I know it will match my style - and we never talk about jewelry, so maybe it would be fun to go shopping together. Could we maybe go shopping together and exchange this for a new piece and we can look at some jewelry?"" Not positioning it as blame - ""you got me the wrong jewelry"" - but as an opportunity - you haven't done this sort of thing together before and it would be nice. And then, stop. Let him respond. Don't assume you know what he will say. Listen. And then respond yourself from there to what he actually says rather than what you imagine he will say. Now, it sounds like you did talk to him about it, and it sounds like nothing terrible happened! It sounds like it was fine! So you didn't even need to wait until 4 a.m.! Also it is okay to show your spouse that you are worried and upset about something. That is an important part of communication. Rather than worry about hurting his feelings you could tell your husband that you love him and are worried about hurting his feelings, but you don't know if it would even really bother him that much. So it is hard to talk about. People read and hear so much about bad marriages, and especially with people who have in the past had painful relationships with loved ones - it can be hard to realize that you can communicate about your emotional vulnerability in a relationship, and it can be okay. Your spouse can support you in this. A lot of spouses do! So yeah, I guess the simplest advice would be you can deal with negative feelings in communication with a loved one by talking about the feelings - by giving them a voice rather than trying to suppress them. Do not assume they will be mad at you - be open to the possibility that they may love you and validate you and want you to be happy. Hiding your inconvenient feelings does not make marriage easier. ]"

I also appreciate a lot the care and empathy in it, that's rare enough to name it :) My husband and I are communicating a lot actually and he is very well aware of my shortcomings. He did it impulsively because he could and because we had a discussion the day before over me working so hard on myself so he wanted me to remember I did it for myself and that he loved me for that. He doesn't listen though to what he classify as a detail in his head (she likes white gold) but I can't really blame him, for me it's important, for him it's trivial, who cares, we all have different set of priorities. So that stinged a bit but that wasn't the problem for me. This was for me more of an ah ah moment. I am really invested in healing nowadays and I have got feedback from different sources that either I was stressed and tired or ,for the people that know me best, that I am overreacting. Or avoiding conflict altogether. I took it seriously and after one month or two I started to see my pattern, we talk about that openly. This event gave me the opportunity to see the extent of my fears, it's almost everywhere. The most simple stuff is easily loaded and I need to ride the wave of emotions before reacting. You are absolutely right about filling in, I am conscious of that too ,with my mind some time after a discussion. Now I am starting to see it happening DURING the experience itself and it can be challenging. About the jewelry we just had a laugh about it and he is going to see if he can exchange it. But it asked me a solid 9 hours to react. It's better than before I used not to say anything at all after all I said was used against me for a long period of time. I do not know, indeed,anymore (or ever it started fairly early) how to have healthy relationships/communications. The only reference I have is how much I can trust my feelings in situ and express, thus, my truth. Accepting that whole storm of emotions coming in but letting it go. But I will have to repeat the exercise many times before it becomes mine. I think I need some anchoring (nlp) actually (almost talking to myself now but hey, thanks to give me the opportunity!)to help me go through that. Thanks ! ]"

This symbolizes that you are talking about someone without them, gossiping essentially. Good or bad. One of the first lessons of being a Butler is to address the guest to the person paying you. Never the other way around. In more casual settings, you can open up with something like that as an introduction. “Hey, are you Tommy? Are you the one i heard is a carpenter?” And then the other will usually say “hehehe, yeah, I’ve been doing it for….” And the conversation is carried. But by opening up directly with the occupation line before asking their name or relation (like Tommy is Micheal’s Brother “Hey, are you by any chance Michaels brother?”) it seems quite abrasive and can come off in a bad mannered way. So i would say it is generally good to start by asking their name, stating their name, or asking if they have a relation to someone you are already aquainted with. “Hey what’s up, I’m John’s friend Jim. How are you?” To which they reply “Hey! I’m tommy, i know John, me and him go way back”. Have them state the things you already know about them. If you know he is a carpenter, ask him what his job is. This helps reinforce the information you get, and is more of that ‘wow! This guy gets me!’ Type of instance relationship that people like to seek. People want to talk about themselves, so ask them softball questions you already know will be reciprocated well Hope this helps :) ]"
"[5&&HungGarRaven&&POST=How to tell your family/loved ones know you were laid off] Anxiety and shame typically comes with the dread of telling your family/loved ones that you were laid off? Especially if you worry that:- you'll be disappointing them and their expectations of you- they'll have some judgement about you- you won't have a clear identity or purpose anymore- you feel inadequate Confessing bad news about yourself is always stressful, especially when you feel powerless in the situation and feel like your world is changing quickly around you. How can you possibly tell your family this news when you've got all these thoughts/feelings swirling around you and you don't even know where to start? Fortunately, you can begin to reclaim your power during this time of uncertainty by: 👉 Grieve the loss - grief is a perfectly normal emotion, so take time to properly process your own emotions and revisit your own values and goals 👉 Reframe your negative self-beliefs/self-talk about the situation into beliefs that can move you forward - what if you were able to remind yourself that this is an opportunity for growth in new areas as opposed to criticism of your abilities? 👉 Prepare yourself emotionally - does mindfulness help? meditation? therapy? self-care activities? 👉 Be open and transparent - ""I have some bad news and I want to be really honest with you. This is hard for me to share and I'd appreciate your support in listening and hearing me out about this."" Be honest - share about how difficult this is and what you need from them during this time. 👉 Anticipate their concerns/thoughts - Will they be concerned about finances (especially if you have children)? This is a time to be open about this - if you've thought about it, share your thoughts, if not, tell them that also. 👉 Be explicit about what support you need - Chances are they want to support you and help you, but without knowing what you need, they may end up trying things that at best don't help, and at worst, make things feel worse. Giving bad news to family is never easy, especially when you're feeling powerless in the situation yourself. But the more honest and open you can be, the sooner you can move towards healing and finding your next step.","[2&&DocDSD&& Thank you for your insight., It may also be helpful to remember that although we tend to think of unemployment as a personal issue (self blame), unemployment is actually a systemic issue.

I can understand her saying there's a possibility that you might have come off as rude, but she did not follow it up with a ""why"". which you asked. seems to me that it's more of a personal problem of hers than yours. when someone gives constructive criticism, they follow it up with ""you could have done this better"" or ""this is the reason why it seems rude"", but she didn't. I've been and still am at times in your position, dealing with ptsd. I used to be very extroverted and once out of the military, something in me changed. I didn't know the extent of it but I knew something was ""off"" with me. we tend to treat people crude and ""straight forward"", solution oriented and sometimes it comes off as harsh, brash, or rude, when I don't mean it in that way at all. its taken me some time to figure this out, as well as a willingness to learn. I've also had people in my life refuse to explain to me ""what I did wrong"" or how I ""should"" address the issue and they refuse to explain..that was my clue to figure out, that Wtvr action I was perceived of ding wrong was more abut the person saying I was wrong than my action. I would ask my therapists, or run the experience I went through to another trusted individual(very few since I deal w not trusting bc of prior experiences), and they would help me out. also, I would look up videos on the experience I went through, social cues, and watch movies or videos and try and relearn how to interact in the world with civilians and not military members as well as how to behave in a healthy manner. I think you're alright, take this as a learning experience and start slowly practicing with others- it helps if its people you know you won't ever see again, less pressure, or with people who know what you're dealing with and won't judge you negatively but instead give you constructive criticism on hw to fix, change your responses and help you see things from others or a different perspective! ]"

It is easier for me to go in stone faced and give news rather than think about the words to it. It’s pretty hard but i learned this (is it a skill? Is it even healthy? Lol) It takes a second for people to register news. So if you deliver it before you can register it in your mind first, you don’t over think it and then you think about it later. Also, just say words. This is also extremely difficult. The way i play it is i devoid all meaning to the words i say, and it usually comes out as “ahhhhh, i have to tell you this”. A very long ahhhh in disbelief to myself before i deliver the news since again, i am trying to detach the emotion from myself. I usually smile when I’m nervous and raise my eyebrows, so this gives a clue to the other person that what I’m about to say is ‘of something different’. How they respond is how they respond. I hope this was more helpful.

I struggle with this a lot. One thing that has helped me is to consider the alternative: if I am not open with those closest to me, then they can never know the real me, and therefore can’t ever really be close to me. In other words, if I want intimate and satisfying relationships with people, I have to reveal my authentic self to them, warts and all, and be willing to face the possibility of rejection. ]"

I am the core, calm base that supports these different parts of me. I show that part that is having a strong reaction love and acknowledge what it is feeling, and thank it/he/she/them for sharing that concern.

Thank you for sharing this with me. Always remember I’ve got your back.” I sometimes have trouble coming up with words of reassurance, so I imagine a wise, older version of me and ask for her advice on what I can tell that part to offer comfort. Having these conversations with myself helps to create some safety when acting vulnerably with others. Sort of like training wheels. And it makes me more mindful and aware of the thoughts and feelings that are passing through my mind on a daily basis and sort of separate my core self from those feelings. It helps me be less afraid of feeling all my feelings, and I needed to do this self-work first to be okay with my own thoughts before I began sharing with others more comfortably. It lessened feeling of “I need this person to get what I’m about to say in the best way possible or else I’ll never be understood and therefore will never be loved”. Lessened the stakes. Because even if this person doesn’t understand, my core self will and will be there with loving grace for that part that needs to be heard. So convos with others hold less importance for going perfectly, if that makes sense. Then if the convo doesn’t go as planned with the other person, I do this exercise about that experience.

"[6&&ProserpinaFC&&POST=Am I ""changing the topic"" or is it a problem just when I unintentionally offend someone?] Sometimes people get upset with me for a range of issues that can best be summarized as ""not staying on topic."" But I often get frustrated right back saying that I am giving my perspective, life experience, or adding information they may have not had known about. And I feel they are disrespecting me, because if I can't say anything they weren't already aware of, I basically feel like a Yes Woman. Examples: A couple Popes ago, I congratulated my Catholic friend on the new Pope because he looked like a real man of the people, and I said ""Wouldn't it be cool if the Vatican funded a worldwide Renaissance, just, celebrated art from across the world?"" This upset her. Because I guess it never occurred to her that the Church paid Michelangelo to paint the Sistine Chapel. She was so upset with me for implying that the church used donations to do anything but ""teach Jesus"" that she stopped speaking to me for a while. (This subject didn't elaborate further. It's not like I mentioned the Church funding New World expeditions, or the Crusades, or something. I literally only said ""new Renaissance"" and ""yeah, like Mickey painting the Chapel"" and she ghosted me.) I had to break up with my first boyfriend because regardless of how much he insisted he cared about me, I didn't feel that way if he resented my knowledge. He loved it at first, because he loves hot takes and controversial opinions. But after he realized I knew more about his conspiracy theories than he did, he stopped wanting to talk to me because he couldn't impress me with Facebook-level knowledge. He even stopped talking to me about our religion when he realized I'd practiced it longer!!! And this applied to everything. Once, I used English and German being cousin languages as a metaphor for something we were talking about, which didn't work because he didn't know that. I gave him a short and sweet review: ""Oh, the name Anglo-Saxon refers to two tribes from Germany. They migrated to the British Isles over a thousand years ago."" I did not talk his ear off. But, he hates anything related to Germany, so he snapped at me like I freakin' quoted Mein Kempf. (Not that that's an unusual reaction for me. People have called me a secret Nazi-supporter for knowing a very broad strokes history of Europe. One guy called me an immortal witch for saying out loud a very basic cause and effect explanation for why we had two world wars. So, not unusual, but it's kind of hurtful when it comes from the guy you're dating.) Or my best friend was praising black celebrities who wear their natural hair. I agreed with him and threw in my perspective about black women who reject hyper glamorous makeup as well. And he got mad at me and said ""there you go again you're changing the topic"" because he liked glamorous makeup. And after we argued for a bit, I tried to get us to back pedal and I pointed out to him that the reason I associated the two is because for black women glamorous makeup starts with lightning the skin tone with foundation, and then glamorizing. (""Go look on YouTube. Compare black make up videos to white.) So, when he brings up black women taking pride in their hair, I associated that with black women taking pride in their actual skin tones. I wasn't saying that ladies can't get dolled up. But he was still grumbling at me that now I went into my ""try to make myself sound right phase."" I got mad right back and said that there's nothing to be right about, and he's being a jerk if he wants to pretend he doesn't see why I associated the two.

I have Aspergers and can throw out a lot of details like that, which some people get and some don't, and your experience sounds somewhat familiar. It is common for autistic, ADHD etc. people to use similar communication styles to relate to others (we often ""build"" a conversation topic together by tossing interesting details or similar personal experiences back and forth as a way to say ""I get you"" - it's not interrupting in this style, it's collaborative). Others don't necessarily have the same ""collaborative"" style and seem to be more focused on turn-taking and going from point A to point B, so they interpret deviation from that as taking over the conversation when that's not your intent. To us, insistence on a linear, ""guided"" conversation and interpreting our shared anecdotes as necessarily attempting to take over the conversation seems rude. To them, ""butting in"" with what they see as irrelevant information also seems rude. I don't have much of a solution, but being able to recognize the fundamental difference in communication styles is at least a first step. ]"

One guy called me an immortal witch for saying out loud a very basic cause and effect explanation for why we had two world wars. So, not unusual, but it's kind of hurtful when it comes from the guy you're dating.) Or my best friend was praising black celebrities who wear their natural hair. I agreed with him and threw in my perspective about black women who reject hyper glamorous makeup as well. And he got mad at me and said ""there you go again you're changing the topic"" because he liked glamorous makeup. And after we argued for a bit, I tried to get us to back pedal and I pointed out to him that the reason I associated the two is because for black women glamorous makeup starts with lightning the skin tone with foundation, and then glamorizing. (""Go look on YouTube. Compare black make up videos to white.) So, when he brings up black women taking pride in their hair, I associated that with black women taking pride in their actual skin tones. I wasn't saying that ladies can't get dolled up. But he was still grumbling at me that now I went into my ""try to make myself sound right phase."" I got mad right back and said that there's nothing to be right about, and he's being a jerk if he wants to pretend he doesn't see why I associated the two. But he accuses me of being rude right back because it doesn't matter because bringing up lightening skin is ""changing the topic."" And sometimes people say that. That if I am pointing out to them that we do agree on 80% of what we're talking about, that that's really me trying to make myself sound right no matter what. And at that point I no longer understand what people want. 1) If I ask them follow up questions, they are mad because they wanted me to agree with them and be impressed with their conclusions with not enough information to convince me. So somehow me saying ""that's interesting; tell me more"" is insulting and condescending. 2) If I focus on disagreeing with them, I'm a terrible person for starting an argument. 3) If I focus on what we agree about, I'm a terrible person for trying to be right. 4) If I say let's agree to disagree, clearly it is some convoluted way to smugly say I'm still right, so they think they have some right to have an attitude about tolerating others' opinions as long as they can accuse me of being smug. 5) If I point out that I'm quoting an objective fact with a creditable source, I'm not ""right"" but if they have some information I wasn't privy to, they are free to give it to me, I'm such a terrible person for thinking my informed opinion is superior to theirs. 6) If I'm associating ideas and telling a story, I am making everything about me. And this upsets me when it's friends and people I want to be friends with. I always try to be mindful of how much people may want to talk, or how deep they would want to conversation to go, or what they wanted to get out of talking when they started to. Maybe a person just wants a listening ear, or maybe they are too angry to hear a different perspective right now. Or maybe they thought that this was going to be a 5-minute exchange and I turned it into a 30-minute conversation. I'm not upset about those things, and I completely understand that. But when people I want to care about me read malicious intent into simply how I think, how I talk, and how I form my opinions... that's hurtful. (Or just bring rude and retroactively insisting they were allowed to be because I was rude first.) When they don't see any value in how I am. When they disengage with me because I'm not moved by how they think. When I want to understand them more.... But they don't want to be understood, they want to be believed, trusted, validated. And I ask why they talked to me at all, it's because they know I'm smart and they want to use that smartness to validate themselves by just getting me to agree. ""See, even SHE says so!"" How do I talk to people if how I talk and think upsets people so much?","[3&&confused_each_day&& You sound a lot like my ex husband.

Conversations on opinion, can take place over decades. On any given topic, you will meet people who have a different base set of knowledge, and different opinions.

I work in kitchens, hotels, and hospitals, so I am constantly challenged to keep information succinct, and finish one point before clearly moving on to another. Working in sales has enlightened me to one very simple fact: most of the time, people don't hear the first sentence you say. So, I'm trying, if nothing else, to use more filler sentences to give people the TIME to hear me, realize I'm throwing them a curveball, and dare I say, tell me whether they want to hear it. ""You know, that reminds me of something that happened to me last week."" ""Can I ask you a question, make sure we are on the same page?"" This is completely new (and cringey) for me. When my best friend calls me, we don't say hello. We just start immediately talking about how the French revolution influenced Japanese anime, or complaining about work. It kind of disturbs me when all a person has to say about a movie they just watched is, ""I liked it."" But my real issue is when people insult me for being passionate. I just...

Next thing I know, she's getting off the bus and away from me as fast as possible. I join in complaining problematic issue in something my friend likes and he doesn't want to hear it compared to another problematic issue he WAS complaining about. I mentioned that Germany exists.

Idk.,"[3&&ProserpinaFC&& The general consensus is that if I say anything with too much confidence, it makes people feel like they aren't allowed to have an opinion at all. Like I think I am the definitive viewpoint on anything I say. So it doesn't even matter if I'm saying ""what do you think?"" ""Well, if you feel differently, what brought you to that conclusion?"" ""I think that way because of XYZ source, have you heard of that? Do you want to read about it?"" I am never against learning more, but when people have nothing to say, they act like I must be sarcastic in asking for their views. But all I hear when I hear people say that is that they don't like hearing other people's views either and they just don't like how I sound. The most recent thing was me and some new acquaintances watching a show that features a gangster/ juvenile delinquent, and I was giving not only my experiences of having grown up in that culture but giving the experiences of men I know, (because I asked them about their lives). And these two women, who don't have my experience and don't know anything about gang culture still wanted to tell me that I might be wrong simply because, who knows, I might be wrong. Therefore I'm the rude one for pointing out that maybe they should listen to the one person in the room who actually got into gang fights as a kid. They didn't even have to believe me, but the least I could do is engage with me. Ask me questions about my life experiences. Like I asked them. Because I LIKE listening to them. And they agreed in so much as they agreed that they do like being listened to, but then their eyes glazed over, and they went right back to a new conversation, so I let it go. ]"

"[6&&rinyamaokaofficial&&POST=ELI5: Where does ""rolling your eyes"" come from and why is it rude?]","[4&&JerryConn&& Many cultures have preferred gesturing norms that correlate to different expressions of emotion or feelings. For many bourn between 1950 and 1990, the gesture of rolling one's eyes is/was predomantly seen as ""flippant"" and often viewed negatively. This is likely one generation s views and is not a universal expression. Many younger generations will not hold the same stigmas as the previous generations and thus over time we will see it take on different meanings. The deaf community could use eyerolling to signify different things in their communities . Think of the ""talking on the phone"" hand gesture. Back when landlines were common, handsets were the phones that people used. In a social context, to stick your pinky out and hold your thumb up to your ear, as a gesture, then taking your hand away from your face and quickly moving it in a downward motion could have been interpreted as ""I dont want to talk to you anymore"" or an attempt to end a conversation. Children born after the invention of the smart phone will not use this gesture to signify talking on the phone. They will, instead, hold their hand up to their face, all fingers together and thumb imitating holding the edge of a rectangle. To the younger generation, the way they chose to symbolize ""phone"" is different and we, as a culture, will slowly adapt to that new symbol.

"[26&&HungGarRaven&&POST=Words/Phrases to avoid in high stress conversations] Do you ever get worried about saying the wrong thing in a high-stress conversation? I got you - avoid these common word/phrase traps: ❌ ""Always"" or ""never"" - people are complex creatures and this will more likely than not be taken as accusatory and generalizing. People will rarely do something ALL the time or NONE of the time. You'll also get trapped in a power struggle about how often the other person is or isn't doing something. ❌ ""But"" or ""However"" - these words always negate everything that came beforehand. ""I understand how you feel, but..."" || ""I'm not racist, but..."" See how it sounds? ❌ ""You just don't understand"" - condescending/belittling, it's not worth it. It's also contradicts everything about the philosophy of taking the time to understand the other person and their point of view. ❌ ""Calm down"" or ""Relax"" - This is super dismissive of the other person's emotions and experience.

I'll share some steps that helped me: Learn to appear approachable and learn to initiate conversations. Nervous body language speaks volumes, and can easily convince people that you'd rather not be talking to them -- which obviously kills your chances of things going further. Work-up the courage to initiate conversations. Be prepared for some less-than-warm receptions. It might be you (which you can fix) or it might be them (who cares, move on to the next). Learn how to have high-quality small talk. Ask unexpected questions, genuinely listen and respond to show you care, ask questions that elicit happy memories/thoughts, look for common interests, etc (do some more research on this topic) Once you've got a foot in the door with someone, keeping them on the line requires you to have something interesting to share, so get some hobbies, and be willing to talk about them. After that, things will either progress or stagnate, naturally, based on compatibility. I would advise reading ""Captivate"" by Vanessa VanEdwards. Most of these insights come from there. ]"

Here are several tips that may help you: Attend social events: it’s a great way to meet new people and expand your social circle. There are many different types of social events that you can attend, including parties, networking events, community gatherings, and more. Volunteer: when you volunteer for a cause you care about, you're likely to meet like-minded individuals who share your values and interests. Show interest in others: ask them about their interests, hobbies, and passions. Listen carefully to their responses and ask follow-up questions. Find communication platforms: this is a great and time-saving way to befriend someone with similar interests and values. Take initiative: don't wait for others to approach you. Take the initiative and introduce yourself to new people. Invite them to coffee or lunch, or suggest doing an activity together that you both enjoy. Have an amazing day! ✨ ]"

Are you maybe defaulting to A, B, or C more frequently than the others? I think the key is to hit all three in conversations at various moments. This involves reading the person- ask questions like the below: Is my conversation partner sharing something painful or emotional? Then (C) is the most appropriate right away- perhaps with a few small comments like “that must have been really hard.” When the person is done talking, you might do a summary of what they said back to them to show you were listening, and then comment on how you care for this person’s well- being (ex: “it sounds like you were neglected as a child. I’m really sorry you had to go through that”). However, depending on your relationship with the person and if/how you relate to their struggles, either (A) or (B) could be appropriate AFTER you are sure the person feels heard. Another question to ask is if you’re conversation partner is done telling their story or if they have more to say. If they’re in the middle of the story or have not yet reached their “point,” they would view (A) as an interruption. Either (B) or (C) could work in this context, but (B) used too frequently before they reach “the point” could also be seen as an interruption. But (B) sprinkled in once in a while, however, shows the person that you’re listening and absorbing what they’re saying. What has the balance been in the conversation in terms of turn taking? Am I talking a lot more than them or a lot less? If you haven’t said much and keeping opting for (C), they’ll view you as not really engaged in the conversation. If you’ve already said a lot and opt for (A), they may view you as self-centered. Something to keep in mind here is that different cultures have different norms for time between speakers. People on the east coast in the US, for example, have less time/less silence between two people having a convo. People in the Midwest may be sitting patiently “waiting” to talk as to not interrupt the other person, and meanwhile the person from the east coast is thinking that they are carrying the entire conversation and this other person must not have much to say because they are used to a little “overlap” where one speaker starts before the other is 100% silent. I personally am from the Midwest and am comfortable with deliberate pauses and silences to be sure my conversation partner has time to add things to the convo. ]"

There isn't an ""appropriate"" way that you can apply to all human beings, sadly. However, one thing I've learned about humans is that they'll like to talk about themselves an awful lot if given the chance. So many people say I'm a good listener, but that's just because I've taught myself to ask questions so I can learn about people. It's a dorky thing, but G.I. Joe had it right: knowledge is power, and knowing is half the battle. If you know more about the person you're talking to while they don't know much about you, you have the power in that situation. And if you want to use that power to get them to like you, continue asking about them until they finally start asking you about yourself. At that point, they've invited you to share. And you can either take it or keep your walls up. If someone never bothers asking me about me, then I don't put too much energy into them because clearly they like being interviewed more than they like making genuine human connections. And you can't take that personally. That's their decision, you can't force someone to ask questions about you. But you can certainly make that person feel like you're approachable, interested in hearing what they have to say, and actively engaged by reacting to what they're saying instead of just waiting to speak your turn.

"[4&&Whirlwind-phoenix&&POST=Languge of the individual vrs language of the system (non political, language focus, individual meaning focus)] If you think about it, language and words are nothing more than tools to convey a meaning to somone else, but not every time we communicate are we heard properly. This is becuse we assume we speak the same language (IE english) when we arent taking into account that we are speaking our own understanding of the english system. What I mean by this is language has no tangable meaning, as such we have our own understanding of what a word means, and will take in information from it based on how it applys to our own system of understanding for it. Words are nothing more than lables, but what causes alot of confusion and misunderstandings is the difference in our ""languages"" creating different meanings than we intend as due to personal language differences. Take a moment to think of a time you were saying one thing and somone else took it for another. Now think of what you said vrs what they thought you ment. This happens all the time and is often the cause of many cinflicts, but not always becsue they dissagree, but becuse they think they disagree. For instnace I noticed that most people generally push towards the same thing, but say if somone starts talking about love, what do they mean? For my girlfriend she talks about somone giving her attantion and making her feel good and valuble while helping them do what she thinks is needed. For me I talk about simply caring for an individuals well being and growth to be able to achive what they want in life. We both seek a genral sense of support, but what love is, is different to each of us, and we often don't see eachothers attempts of love as love all the time, alot of times we feel like we are trying to hinder and hurt eachother.... until we communicate more and relaize what the other is doing and find ways to be more accomidating and mindful of the differences in idea. This can happen on less perosnal instances as well, for example some of the most controversial things in society are often bound by personal definitions. This includes freedom, equality, fairness, family, and more. When I was younger, I used to constantly change my definitions of words to accomidate for the different people I met, as I hated being misunderstood.... this also lead me to overexplain myself by giving my definition of the words at times to help clear the meaning. This tought me how many different meanings people give the same word. So here is the bounus question, what kind of words do you think are often misunderstood becuse of peoples different personal meanings?","[1&&gengisadub&& I’ll just add that the words we use allow us to communicate in different ways. For instance, using the word “love” as you did is a shorthand for the way you interpret what a loving individual looks like, does, and how they behave. But it also has a specific meaning. When you meet someone for the first time you can say “I love pizza” and they generally understand what you mean, so that you can get to the point of your conversation. But at some point you have to be more specific about the meaning to provide the context needed to articulate what you ACTUALLY mean when you say “I love pizza.” Otherwise there is no guarantee that they understand what you are saying. Language allows us to relate to each other and share experience without actually experiencing, but you can’t always operate in this realm. This is where conflict has potential to creep in as interpretation has enough room to alter the meaning from what is said to what is heard or understood. I try to communicate as specifically as possible with a new audience (those who are not familiar with me) and tend to relax and use more general language when that audience is more familiar. In this way I can be more comfortable in understanding that my audience is interpreting what I’m saying in the ways that I intend. But of course there will always be misinterpretation and that will leave room for conflict. ]"

Family values are still held strong because they’re all Reganomics Babies. But a generation younger happens to more conservative. Noticing how with the absolute abundance of everything on the internet, the kids gravitated to speaking their thoughts, talking things out and recognizing toxic families and behaviors. They see the ridiculousness of their predecessors behaviors and realize that is not the healthy way to go.

"[19&&curiositykilledmatt&&POST=What I've Learnt From Speaking With Strangers] Striking up conversations with strangers has never come naturally to me. In fact, I often feel anxious in social opportunities and more often than not, don’t make the approach. I’ve been taking small steps using card prompts to become more confident approaching and starting conversations with complete strangers. So far with the process I’ve learnt: Okay, maybe not all of it but a lot more than you’d think. As soon as you get out of your own head and you start approaching people and you start talking you realise that most people are nice. We all know on an intellectual level that approaching a stranger won’t result in any harm. Does that do anything to help our nerves? Absolutely not! If you want to become more confident speaking with people, then you have to speak with people. The good thing about doing it my way with slow increments is that it hasn’t as daunting as say, telling yourself to go up and speak to 5 people every day. When you shine the light on someone else, they’re more often than not really excited and happy at just being seen. When you ask someone how they are, look into their eyes and smile, it makes a difference to them and you can tell. A nice side-effect from speaking to people around me is that now, I have a community of poeple I see and interact with. Instead of man I see at the cafe, it’s now George who used to work in marketing. The world gets a bit more cosy when you start saying hello to those around you. Typically I’d go about asking very dead end questions which surprise surprise, ended with dead end answers. By expanding questions, intruiging further and starting with ‘who, what, where, when, why’, I’ve really expanded my conversational repetoire. The idea of approaching a cute girl across the bar and starting a conversation from scratch is still daunting but it’s a hell of a lot closer than it was when I started. TLDR: Get out of your own head. Understanding it’s scary ≠ is no longer scary. Everyone enjoys being the focus of attention. The world gets smaller with every interaction you have. “Why do you do what you do” > “What do you do?”. I’m not there yet but I’m further along than I was.",[2&&Livebeam&& Wow!

Why the double question marks? It reads as frustration or annoyance.,[0&&november_xxx&& umm.. no ]
umm.. no,"[1&&bsievers&& Yeah. Including several in a row can read as yelling or that you are angry; multiple question marks in place of one can be interpreted as frustration or rudeness. https://www.mycareeradvisor.com/articles/best-practices-in-email-etiquette#:~:text=Be%20Mindful%20of%20Punctuation&text=Including%20several%20in%20a%20row,interpreted%20as%20frustration%20or%20rudeness. ]"
"[8&&curiositykilledmatt&&POST=The Road to Being Confident with Strangers: I Started A Conversation With A Girl and It Almost Felt Natural!] The idea of going up to a stranger, saying hello and being confident is nerve wracking. So I’ve decided to do something about it. I’ve made some cards which have prompts, conversation or exercises which I’m using to help me become more confident speaking to strangers. Today’s prompt was ‘Ask a stranger how their day is going’ Before: I’ve been doing this for a while so it’s a lot less intimidating. At the start of this experiment, the idea of start a conversation from cold was so intimidating but now I’ve done it a few times, it’s almost second nature to be looking for conversations and opportunities to speak with people. Experience: I was waiting for a train this morning and saw a girl my age. I think before I would have gone into my own world but I swallowed my anxiety (or as much as I could muster) and said ‘Good Morning, How’s your day going’ which opened up a nice conversation. Thoughts: The more I do this, the less intimidating it is, the better I get at it and the more satisfying it is. I’m almost looking forward to the harder challenges I’ve set myself in the future which is fascinating given a week ago, the idea of starting a conversation with someone would have made me a nervous wreck. I'm also really glad I've made it process orientated and slowly driven up the difficulty instead of making it an unsurmountable task, it feels like a steady progression which I can hang on to. If you have any thoughts/ideas for prompts which I could use to slowgress towards confidence with strangers then lmk.",[2&&wherewhoami&& this is such an awesome idea!!! please keep posting updates as you try harder challenges — i’m feeling inspired to try this out too! ]
