What does your tool do that Jira doesn’t?,"[-9&&get-more-seconds&& My tool, mDash, is the only AI-powered project management platform made specifically for web development. It automatically generates accurate quotes, timelines, developer assignments, status updates, and more, taking you from project request to kick off in less than a minute. It keeps the project organized and status clear from start to finish. Jira's great, but you still need a technical project manager to spend hours breaking down, building out, and assigning the tasks. Depends on the project and feature, but you need a storyboard, Epics for different pods, multiple meetings, and more planning with status summaries, story points, and descriptions. This can change but on the shorter end, it takes more than a week from client meeting to a first actual ticket assignment a dev can work on. With my tool, the client puts in a request and I can get a dev on tasks within that hour. On top of wasted time, it's also way too easy to lose track of a ticket in Jira builds. Tickets take so long to get written. If a PM isn't technical you're right back to the tech lead and I've seen way too many tickets get lost in the shuffle. ]"
"So I have been working on an idea, but have no experience in building a platform or app to keep stakeholders honest in construction, what can Mdash do to help me?","[-1&&get-more-seconds&& That's an interesting idea, and I think it would be a valuable platform to build as construction projects are notorious for going over budget, and taking much more time than previously expected. There are a lot of parallels between web/software development, and construction. I used that industry as a parallel and did some research there while building out the initial feature set for mDash. If you are a non-technical founder, and especially if you are going to work with an external remote dev team, you absolutely want oversight of your project at all times, and you want confirmation regarding expectations, budget tracking, velocity tracking, etc. mDash will do all of that for you. It'll ensure your specs are translated to ""developer speak"", it'll set your initial expectations as far as budget and timeline go, and then it will allow you to ""watch"" your developers work life and progress through the project. It's a very similar concept to you being a foreman/forewoman on a work site and overseeing a construction job on a daily basis. Otherwise, you'll have to hire a technical PM, which is going to cost you 1-2 engineers salary. ]"

Which are both fair arguments. I don't personally see it that way, but I understand that sentiment. I've had the idea for mDash ( our platform ) for years, long before commercial AI data models were household names ( ex. openAI ). And all during that time I have been building a development agency ( from scratch ). So the models and algorithms that power our system, largely come from our company's internal data sets. We have worked on thousands of projects, which are broken into tens of thousands of tasks. We meticulously tracked all of their data points ( like complexity, area of focus, etc ), and tracked time on them ( so we know how long they take to complete ). We used these spreadsheets to create the initial models that are now used to auto-scope projects, or auto-assign developers to tasks, etc. We utilize GPT as well to reformat project submission requests into more technical descriptions/titles. Largely what we have is just built from personal experience, and years of doing the actual job. I don't believe that is an ethically grey area to convert our hard work into a useful tool. Now 1 caveat, we're opening this platform to the public. Meaning that as other outside agency's, devs, PMs, etc use it, their information will also be used to better train the model in performing its duties. You can look at that as benefiting the development community as a whole, or as a small net loss to those users as they receive indirect, but not direct benefit. ]"

We meticulously tracked all of their data points ( like complexity, area of focus, etc ), and tracked time on them ( so we know how long they take to complete ). We used these spreadsheets to create the initial models that are now used to auto-scope projects, or auto-assign developers to tasks, etc. We utilize GPT as well to reformat project submission requests into more technical descriptions/titles. Largely what we have is just built from personal experience, and years of doing the actual job. I don't believe that is an ethically grey area to convert our hard work into a useful tool. Now 1 caveat, we're opening this platform to the public. Meaning that as other outside agency's, devs, PMs, etc use it, their information will also be used to better train the model in performing its duties. You can look at that as benefiting the development community as a whole, or as a small net loss to those users as they receive indirect, but not direct benefit.","[3&&CornishCucumber&& Thanks for going in depth. Sounds good! I've been playing with AutoML, SD and the ChatGPT api over the last 6 months and it's certainly changing the landscape of development. I also do a lot of digital art as well as front end dev - so part of me is terrified, but also intrigued. Good luck with the business, and thanks for taking the time to reply. ]"

How'd swapping PM systems go? I can't imagine that being fun for the devs.,"[-2&&get-more-seconds&& Hey, good question. Our PM platform, the mDash, was built for my team, by my team. Developers knew the change was coming and we were able to plan so it was relatively easy to switch. Their tasks were pre-assigned and ready to go when they first logged on. Also, my team's continued feedback as they used it proved invaluable in making it better for others. The tricky thing was implementing changes while my team and my clients are actively using and effectively being beta testers. Ultimately though the feedback from my team is that it's wayyy easier than the multiple-platform thing we were doing. It's easy to log on and see exactly what they are doing for the day with relevant info, timelines, and the ability to get questions answered right away. Devs just want to code. With the mDash they get to just code. That being said, for any agency, it's daunting to move a whole team or many teams away from what they are familiar with. I kept that in mind building the mDash and aimed for frictionless implementation. ]"

Is there a danger they will become an invasive species? Ie if a curious student plants them in their garden?,"[71&&FastPlantsJackson&& Great question, this is one we occasionally receive from teachers as well. It is very unlikely that Fast Plants would ever become an invasive species. In over 40 years of Fast Plants being used in education, we have never received a report of an invasive/escaped population. Fast Plants growth requirements are easy to provide in a classroom/research indoor growing environment, but Fast Plants do not grow well in outdoor conditions. Fast Plants require 24 hour lighting for optimal growth, therefore natural outdoor/solar light does not provide sufficient lighting and plants will be weak. Fast Plants also require continuous moisture availability; they are susceptible to drought stress and cannot survive the variable moisture conditions outdoors. ]"

Will add to this that there are already weed Brassicas that set seed in a similar timeframe and continue to seed continuously for months. They can complete several generations in a year. The wild varieties are likely far more resilient to real world conditions.,"[1&&FastPlantsJackson&& This is a great addition, there are absolutely wild/weedy Brassicas that are distributed around the world, many wild varieties are quite hardy and can tolerate a range of environments. Some weedy varieties grow quickly and can produce a great amount of seed; however, their weedy growth and less-predictable life cycle make them less well adapted to the classroom. In this, we have a teaching/learning opportunity. To compare the growth and development of wild/weedy Brassicas with domesticated Wisconsin Fast Plants, a teacher/class could grow a population of Fast Plants in their classroom and concurrently grow weedy or vegetable Brassicas in their school garden! The Brassica genus is full of variation and genetic diversity; an example of this is evident in the wide variety of domesticated Brassica vegetables. Cauliflower, broccoli, turnips, bok choy, kale, brussels sprouts, cabbages, and kohlrabi are all Brassica vegetables, and there are more too! The genetic diversity in Brassicas allowed farmers in history to breed/select for all these vegetables we know today. The same genetic diversity allowed for the initial selection of rapid-cycling Brassicas and Wisconsin Fast Plants (see question from reddit user saladspoons below). Brassica breeding continues today for both culinary and industrial purposes. For anyone interested in learning more about Brassica variation and breeding/domestication, check out our video Brassicas Around the World & Wisconsin Fast Plants. For teachers, this video is part of a larger open source NGSS-aligned lesson, fully and freely available here. ]"

"Are these used primarily for demonstrating life cycle, or are they used as test subjects for...I don't know- optimizing growing conditions or toxins or...?","[22&&FastPlantsJackson&& All of the above! Teaching/demonstrating plant life cycles is certainly a primary use for Fast Plants in the classroom. (You can watch an annotated timelapse of the Fast Plants Life Cycle on our Youtube channel here). For teachers seeking Life Cycle lessons for their classrooms, here are links to free, Open Source Elementary and Middle School NGSS-aligned Life Cycle Investigations. Fast Plants are highly responsive to their growing environment, so they can also be used to demonstrate the effect of different growing conditions on plant growth. Genotype x Environment = Phenotype. Changing the growing environment by modifying available fertilizer, soil volume, light intensity, temperature, etc. will result in variation in plant biomass, flower number, seed yield, etc. (Timelapse video of different lighting conditions here). Since Fast Plants grow so quickly, testing the effects of different growing conditions can be completed in only a few weeks in the classroom, providing students with the opportunity to observe firsthand, the impact of different growing environments on Fast Plants growth. ]"

"[39&&UnderTheHenfluence&&POST=I’m Tove Danovich, journalist and head hen keeper at Best Little Henhouse. I’m also the author of the book Under the Henfluence! AMA about chickens, writing, and the flock!] Hello! I’m Tove (rhymes with “nova”) and I wrote the book Under the Henfluence: Inside the World of Backyard Chickens and the People Who Love Them which was published in the US and UK earlier this year. Under the Henfluence is a reported memoir about getting to know my own chickens, who chickens are as a species, and our long history together. In addition to a lot of historical research, I also traveled around the country to learn about chickens. I got to visit the biggest chicken show in America, see feral chickens that roost in trees at night, and even went to a camp where people learn how to clicker train chickens. (They are very food motivated and can be trained!) Those are just some of the adventures I talk about in the book. Most people don’t think much about chickens if they think about them at all but they are social, communicative, and even have culture!

So everyone seems to agree we need our creative writers to power the entertainment ecosystem.

"This seems to have been a long fought battle that is still happening, are there any signals from the companies on giving into demands soon? If so what are the terms being discussed?","[42&&thisisinsider&& There aren't really signals that the companies are softening their positions at this point in time, though so much of the process of a union negotiation takes place behind-the-scenes, oftentimes in secretive sessions between the two sides, and there's a strange undercurrent of a language being spoken that can be quite different from what people see from the outside.That said, this was always going to be a long slog. From the beginning, industry insiders believed this labor stoppage could go through late autumn, potentially the holidays (even though many are hoping it ends far sooner than that!). One hope was that, if SAG-AFTRA's membership (eg. unionized actors) joined the fight, that the tide could turn in the favor of the strikers and intensify the pressure so heavily on the studios that they'd be forced to come to the table sooner. Ultimately, of course, SAG-AFTRA did join the fight in July, though it doesn't seem like their arrival on the picket lines has greased the wheel of too expeditious a resolution so far. In other words, this is going to go on a while, is the general consensus. Here's one indication of the mood. Earlier this month, the Writers Guild of America announced that its negotiating team met with top Hollywood CEOs like Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav and Disney CEO Bob Iger, among others. The two sides met on August 22. It doesn't appear to have accelerated reaching an accords. ""We were met with a lecture about how good their single and only counteroffer was,"" WGA spokespersons told the media, adding that the discussion ""wasn't a meeting to make a deal,"" in their view. ""This was a meeting to get us to cave... We will see you all out on the picket lines so that the companies continue to see what labor power looks like."" ]"
"Do these unions have sufficient funds to compensate their members with strike pay? If not, how are members getting by?","[66&&thisisinsider&& There are indeed strike funds for members of the unions, but they're reserved for people in really dire need. Not everyone can take advantage (nor does everyone need to), but those who seek funding need to be able to show why they need it. A lot of people are scrambling to find part-time or second jobs outside of the creative industry to make ends meet. It's a tough situation for all parties involved. The strikers are well aware of this, and in fact, their struggle now only has bolstered, I think, their conviction why they need to keep fighting so that they can work in an industry where they can sustain themselves just from their creative jobs. ]"

Several big name actors have contributed to a strike fund.,"[30&&FillsYourNiche&& AP news mentions $15 million donated: The SAG-AFTRA Foundation, a nonprofit with a mission to support the members of the actors union, quickly raised $15 million with $1 million donations from Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck, Oprah Winfrey and Julia Roberts in the first three weeks of the actors strike. Other $1 million donations came from George and Amal Clooney, Luciana and Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Hugh Jackman and Deborra-Lee Furness, Dwayne Johnson, Nicole Kidman, Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Meryl Streep. ]"
"How do you see this ending realistically? Similar to 2007-2008? Or rather this new status quo being set with slightly better terms for writers , and why","[36&&thisisinsider&& So, taking off my journalist hat for a second and putting on my layman's observer hat who has no special knowledge of whether there's an end date in place or what the end game will look like (no one knows but the negotiators) — I feel on solid ground saying I think this will go on for some time. Whether that means October, November, December, or even January, as one large streaming executive recently told me they believe will be the case — that's anybody's guess and depends on the language being spoken by all sides at the negotiating tables. But I don't think we are imminently approaching an end to this, no. I think it will end with deals that both the WGA and SAG-AFTRA feel satisfied with, because they've made clear they won't accept anything less. But I look at the long game beyond these strikes. The entertainment industry is transforming more rapidly than anyone can imagine, which I've written about here: https://www.businessinsider.com/hollywood-writers-strike-over-technology-ai-netflix-streaming-studios-2023-7 The forces driving this transformation may be temporarily slowed by the deals that the guilds will get, but they won't be repelled. For tech investors in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street, the allure of Hollywood's tech gold rush is too great to resist. I think strikers will win big victories in the short term, yes — but in 15, 20 years, will those victories still protect them? I think there will always be strong appreciation for the actors' and writers' craft, or anything entertainment-related that brings viewers joy, but I think Hollywood needs to understand that it's changing quickly and sometimes in subtle ways. The fight doesn't end with these deals being ratified, and in some ways never will end. There needs to be an acceptance that this is part of a much longer story that's being told — the story of how Hollywood is transforming faster than most of its denizens want it to. ]"
Is it working?,"[30&&thisisinsider&& Depends how we define if it's working! The most obvious way is to ask, did the strikers get what they want? So far, it seems like we're in for a long haul, but the strikers seem adamant not to give in till they get a deal they feel is strong and guarantees the vitality of their professions well into the future. We'll know when it's over if the labor stoppages resulted in the kinds of protections and deals that the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA feel are equitable and capable of accomplishing that goal. But there are other clues that could give us a sense if parts of the strike are working or not. For instance, both guilds prohibit their members from promoting any new content they've worked on during the strike. It's tough because some actors are writers have had projects launch while the strike has been on, and they've been unable to go on the morning shows or promotional campaigns to drive awareness to these projects. That would be playing into the studios' hands, the guilds say. In the short term, the strikes appear to have done little to derail the success of the recent blowout box office weekend debuts for films like ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer,"" so one could argue that the actors and writers withholding their star power didn't put many chinks in the studios' or distributors' armor during the premieres of those films. But some experts I talk to are telling me to look toward the new film releases in September and, if the strikes are still going on, in October, too. These experts believe that films like ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer"" received so much buzz and attention before the strikes went into effect. But they're confident that, without that same degree of attention and spotlight shone on film releases later this autumn, the studios could really be crushed at the box office. We'll have to wait and see. But the bottom line is that, for now, it's too soon to know whether the labor stoppages are resulting in the kinds of successes the guilds are hoping to see in the bargaining room. ]"

You mentioned drinking causing low sperm count. How much would a person have to drink to affect their sperms?,"[22&&ramasamymd&& There isn't a specific ""unsafe"" amount of alcohol that universally affects fertility, but heavy or excessive alcohol consumption has been linked to negative effects on male reproductive function. Research suggests that heavy drinking, especially chronic or excessive alcohol consumption, can lead to hormonal imbalances that affect testosterone production and sperm quality. As a general guideline, heavy drinking is often defined as consuming more than two to three alcoholic drinks per day on a regular basis. However, even lower levels of alcohol consumption might have negative effects on fertility over time. That said, the impact of alcohol on fertility can be reversible to some extent with moderation and healthy lifestyle choices. ]"

It's determined by a combination of factors which include BMI, overall health, genetics etc. Moderate alcohol intake (which can be defined as something like one drink per day for men) is generally considered safer for fertility. Type of alcohol matters less than overall moderation. You can google alcohol recommendations for men and women, and look at charts that tell you what a standard drink is defined as considering a beer vs shot are different like you mentioned.

After two plus years of nightmares and anxiety, they consulted a psychiatrist, and early in 1964 they began a series of hypnotic therapy sessions. By the end of that process, both had memories of that light on the road in front of them, being taken aboard by small beings, and subjected to medical examination. By the 1970s, they were famous. A journalist wrote a bestselling book based on interviews with the Hills, James Earl Jones produced and starred in a film about the case, and the famous astronomer Carl Sagan argued their story could not be true on his wildly popular PBS series Cosmos. While there's a lot in the book about the case, the book also explains that we can learn a lot about Betty and Barney Hill's experiences about the last fifty or sixty years in American history.

Can I ask what you think the best evidence is that Betty and Barry are telling the truth? And what is the best evidence you have they may not be?,"[105&&MatthewBBowmann&& I think they were telling the truth about what they remembered as they remembered it. I think it shouldn't be terribly controversial that they saw something strange in the sky. About the abduction - well - those memories emerged under hypnosis and as recovered memory, and that's a lot trickier. There's good reason to think that recovered memory needs to be treated carefully. ]"
"Hi, I was just wondering how Carl Jung is related to the UFO or cases like this?","[36&&MatthewBBowmann&& Jung wrote a book called ""Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Sky."" He argued, essentially, that whatever these odd things in the sky are is less important than how we interpret them, and the meanings we place upon them reveal often our own anxieties and longings for peace. A lot of more recent interpreters of UFOs follow his lead on this. ]"
"My biggest concern with the Betty and Barney Hill case is her credibility afterwards. My understanding is Betty Hill claimed to then have HUNDREDs of sighting and close encounters after the events she described. She was then seeing something like one a day, decades later. Do you have anything to say in regards to that? It just seems to point to something like mental illness. I read an interesting case study on it by Karl Pflock.","[110&&MatthewBBowmann&& This is correct. It particularly escalated after Barney's death in 1969. I think that her ideas about what UFOs were evolved after their initial encounter in 1961. Increasingly, through the late 1960s and 1970s, she began connecting UFOs to all manner of other ""high strangeness"" - psychic powers, reincarnation, ghosts and life after death and so on. The early UFO people she came in contact with - Donald Keyhoe and the like - thought of UFOs as not much more than nuts-and-bolts craft built on other planets and flown here. By the 1970s, though, she was interacting with people who connected UFOs to a vast network of cosmic conspiracies, psychic energies, and so on, and began to see them all around her. In a nutshell, I think her journey is an interesting illustration of the rise of the New Age movement in America, growing suspicion of mainline science, and general distrust of government. Lots on this in the book. ]"
I've noticed quite a bit of crossover among Mormons who are active believers in UFOs. Warren Aston is a good example of someone writing about proof for the Book of Mormon and also UFOs. Do you have any theories why it seems being a believing Mormon also seems to indicate a much higher belief in UFOs?,"[47&&MatthewBBowmann&& Also Jim Thompson. I mention this somewhere else, but I think it's two things. 1 - Mormon theology has a strong strain of naturalism in it, which is to say that God is not a 'supernatural' being but rather has total mastery of the existing laws of the universe. Thus, 'religion' and 'science' aren't really different things; thus, the notion of beings traveling across the universe with science is not too far fetched in Mormon theology. 2 - There are scattered passages in Mormon scripture about God ruling multiple planets and having created worlds without end. ]"

Also the research we do on the International Space Station, a lot of it is about biomedical research - and the interesting thing about when you don't have gravity is that crystals grow larger because they don't collapse in on themselves and that means we can study pharmaceuticals and make material so there's really a lot that goes on that benefits of here on Earth.

"What was your experience like in Antarctica!? What was it like living there, were there any interesting things you found out?","[42&&unsw&& Antarctica was a life changing experience. I was there for a whole year and actually got to go back again a couple of months later, but that year was incredible, looking at the stars for example in such an isolated low-light pollution environment was incredible. Every week I would have to go out to this instrument which was about a kilometre away from the base. I'd go out there with a colleague and we would take our headlamps off to let our eyes adjust to the conditions and we would just look up at the stars and you just had such a good vision of it. We had 100 days of darkness, and if it was a moonless day you could actually see your shadow in the light of the Milky Way so that was an incredible experience. I'm not an astronomer but just being able to see that was amazing. Then there was the experience of the tough physical conditions - we reached a temperature and wind chill of -104 degrees Celsius which is not something I ever expected to experience in my life, also the low humidity – Antarctica is actually a desert so that meant that it was extremely low humidity which is pretty tough on the body and the fact that you don't see the sun for 100 days really plays havoc on your sleep. Concordia station is at an altitude of 3233m above sea level but at the poles, the air is thinner and so it's more like being about 4000m. That meant any activity was quite difficult and it also meant that I felt like a bit of a superhero because I had, you know, these lungs that had expanded to be able to deal with that! Unfortunately that only lasts about a month but that was great. So overall it was a fantastic experience with my colleagues. Yes, it was difficult at times but we really became a family.

ESA has 'booked' 5 long-duration flights to the International Space Station over the next few years, and so it is currently training 5 of it's corps with those missions in mind. Depending on various factors - political, financial, capacity - other missions (short or long) might come up. In those cases, the reserves would be called upon. The para' is designated a ""feasibility study"" with the intention (but no promise) of a flight. As it happens, the first person who will fly out of the whole group of them - is one of the reserves (from Sweden) because a short-mission that had not been forseen became available. ]"

"Thank you all for the phenomenal work that you do. I have a few questions for you as someone without an extensive background in physics. Is it right to interpret these results as further evidence that there are unknown particles or forces not currently accounted for in the Standard Model? If that’s the case, what is your best guess as to possible new particles/forces that could explain these results? With all this new info, where do you see particle physics heading in the next couple of decades? Thanks again for pushing the boundaries of science and our understanding of the universe!","[49&&ArgonneLab&& In a nutshell, the difference between the measurements vs. the theoretical calculations indicates a patch we need to add to our current theory. While we are constantly improving our measurements, the theorists are also improving their calculations. While the difference between the recently released result and the theoretical prediction released in 2020 reached 5 sigma (which means extremely unlikely the difference is caused by a statistical error), some of the newer developments in the theoretical calculations yielded values closer to our measurements. As of now, we cannot speak for sure whether there are new particles. A difference only indicates incompleteness in our current Standard Model, and shaves away some new theories that have very different predictions, but it does not speak for sure which one it is. We need to do further experiments to test different theories. As for the future of particle physics, there are a wide range of experiments on different frontiers that help us understand more details. The muon g-2 experiment, as an intensity-frontier experiment, uses high precision measurements to seek discrepancy between reality and theory. You can find more information on intensity frontier experiments at https://www.fnal.gov/pub/science/experiments/intensity/experiments.html. Other two major frontiers are the energy frontier and the cosmic frontier.

"Congratulations to the 25 graduate students earning their doctorate from this data set! I'm so impressed by the level of control you have over this system, what an extraordinary accomplishment. Are there any indications that the charged leptons have quadrupole or higher multipole moments? What kind of cursed, diabolical experiment would allow one to test this?","[2&&ArgonneLab&& The magnetic moment, or magnetic dipole moment, results from the particles intrinsic property of its spin (and electric charge). The g-factor links the spin of a particle to its magnetic (dipole) moment. What we are measuring is this g-factor, or more precisely, the anomalous component of it which is the deviation from 2. Hence the name g-2 of our experiment. There are no magnetic monopoles, so the dipole is the smallest “magnetic unit”. So for fundamental particles, with only one spin, there is only one degree of freedom. But for atoms that consist of multiple fundamental particles and hence multiple spins, for example, there can be higher order multipoles. As an example, a magnetic quadrupole moment leads to some shifts in the hyper fine structure (see here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperfine_structure). You can find a related example of an experiment at Argonne, but for an *electric* dipole moment search, in Radium that exploits the octupole deformation of this atom: https://www.anl.gov/phy/electric-dipole-moments-of-radium225 ]"

"If this result is the product of an actual new force and new gauge bosons, rather than a problem inherent in our predictions using the standard model, is there any idea what the nature of this force would be in order to explain such results? Since the weak force mediates flavor changes and decays, the strong force bind quarks together, etc, what is is that this new force would be responsible for doing? If that makes any sense","[28&&ArgonneLab&& Excellent question. The quantity we measure, the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, receives contributions from all of physics, including physics within the Standard Model (SM) and “new physics” beyond the SM. If this result is confirmed to be in disagreement with the SM, then the difference between our experimental result and the SM prediction would represent the size of contribution from new physics, and would constitute an “indirect” measurement/discovery of physics beyond the SM. That is, it would amount to strong evidence that new physics exists, without telling us its precise nature (whether it be a new force, a new particle, or something else entirely). Unraveling the mystery of what this new physics actually is would be the work of theoretical physicists and future experiments, who would use this result as a powerful indicator as to where to look! ]"

"If the experiment does point to a 5th fundamental force, what are the implications for wider physics? Because we can see the other 4 forces so easily in comparison, what do you think this 5th force is actually doing? Also, if there is confirmation of a 5th force, does it open the door to there being many other hard-to-detect forces? Or do you think this force will mainly be contained to subatomic particles and it's then unlikely we'll find more? Thanks for the interesting topic!","[10&&ArgonneLab&& Please also see our answer to your similar question that our experiment is only sensitive to new physics but not really to its nature. Should we really discover new physics in the future (since we did not yet!), we would need follow up experiments that will tell us more about if this new physics is a new particle or an additional new force. Therefore it is difficult at this point to really speculate about the nature of such new physics – should it be discovered in the future. Given that we have not yet discovered a fifth force or any new particles, it is probably reasonable to assume that it will be more and more difficult to find new physics but scientists around the globe keep on to this challenge with ever better experiments and theoretical calculations. As experimentalists, our focus is on measuring as precisely as we can. ]"

Can you describe your work in the most boring way possible?,"[24&&ArgonneLab&& Muons are one kind of fundamental particle. It’s like an electron but heavier. Like electrons, the muons have a quantity called the spin, you can picture it like a little magnet within the particle. We measure how this spin interacts with a magnetic field. More precisely we are looking at how fast this little magnet rotates in the magnetic field, similar to spinning top. All particles we know in the theory contribute to this interaction / rotation. With this, measuring it allows us to test this theory of all particles, called the Standard Model. Check out this video for more details: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjnK5exNhZ0 The latest result comes from 2 years of measurements, for more details on that check out this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkHd_wxMfrs&ab_channel=Fermilab ]"

What does the surgery entail? What's the recovery period?,"[56&&DrMendelsohn&& Great question! Check out a longer conversation about this on Youtube, but briefly, the day of surgery the patient would come in to the surgery center where an IV is placed and general anesthesia is given. The surgery requires approximately 60 to 90 minutes and patients go home the same day. The discomfort is relatively mild and is best treated with Tylenol and Advil. The most important thing about the recovery process is the voice rest. Different surgeons, request different lengths of voice, rest, but for our patients I ask for two weeks of complete voice rest. ]"

Can you talk about how vocal feminization surgery compares to voice/speech therapy in terms of results?,[76&&DrMendelsohn&& Hi! What a great question. Voice feminization surgery is a part of the treatment which includes voice therapy. We really shouldn't be thinking about voice therapy versus surgery. It's more about seeing if surgery is necessary to achieve certain vocal goals that voice therapy is unable to achieve. ]
"I've read about scar tissue messing with the pitch of the voice after the surgery. How common is that, and can it be fixed?","[48&&DrMendelsohn&& By far this is the most concerning complication which can arise. This is why it's so critical to limit voice use and prevent any type of inflammation, such as mucus drainage to the voicebox during the healing phase. I've had just a few patients come in, from other offices, with severe scarring across the whole vocal cords after this type of surgery, and while we were able to get some improvement, it's really difficult to fix this problem. ]"
Is it possible for someone to lose their voice entirely doing this surgery?,"[40&&DrMendelsohn&& I have seen disastrous complications performed in other operating rooms, including complete vocal cord scarring after this surgery. But it's important that we as surgeons remember that it's more important to focus on safety and have a small percentage of cases which could use a revision (i.e do a little more) than go for the aggressive approach and risk these types of catastrophic injuries. ]"

They're actually on our website. One of our users, Zoe, paid down $2k in a few months on a gig income. Des is another user who paid down over $8k and is now looking to do a refi through us for the remainder.

So what if I don't have any outstanding debt? Would I benefit from this app?,"[5&&Debt_Debbie100&& The dirty little secret is that you can get rewards for being a transactor (someone who pays your balance in full) vs just a revolver. We will be developing a track on the app that is more saving/long term goals focused vs just debt focused in order to serve those users. We also will need to introduce ways to monetize them by expanding the suite of products we refer - in this case, savings and investing makes more sense vs refi. ]"

What I'd suggest is start looking for jobs/industries/companies/organizations that intrigue you now, while you're working on your VO business. Then start reaching out to people for informational interviews, again while you're working on the VO business. Ask them about the things that interest you, and what kind of roles they'd recommend for your particular brain. Then reach out to those people and repeat until you have a couple of titles in your back pocket and know what kind of training might be required.

"[2013&&trevintexas&&POST=Tonight’s Mega Millions Jackpot is $1.1 BILLION. I’ve been studying the inner workings of the lottery industry for years. AMA about lottery odds, the lottery business, lottery psychology, or no-lose lotteries] Hi! I’m Trevor Ford (proof), founding team member at Yotta, a company that pays out cash prizes on savings via a lottery-like system (based on a concept called prize-linked savings). I used to be a regular lottery player, buying tickets weekly, sometimes daily. Scratch tickets were my vice, I loved the instant gratification of winning. I heard a Freakonomics podcast “Is America Ready for a “No-Lose Lottery”? And was immediately shocked that I had never heard of the concept of prize-linked savings accounts despite being popular in countries across the globe.

How different were the calls during the first months of lockdown?,"[74&&CallMeMaybe911&& We had to do a screening on everyone for symptoms of Covid and our people had to wear N95s. People stopped calling as much, actually because no one wanted to go to the hospital but it took forever for our rescues to clear hospitals which thinned out coverage for the county and our response times suffered. They would hold the wall at a hospital anywhere from 2-3 hours for each call because the hospitals were overtaxed and there was simply not enough beds and not enough staff to offload them. Meanwhile they can’t respond to calls so our unit saturation would dip and had to send available rescues from further away. We also got a lot of people calling us from the ER parking lot to go to another hospital because they were tired of waiting at the one they were at. We get those occasionally but not like we did during the heavy days of Covid. We also had to wear N95s at our desk for social distancing and we were split between our main site and back up site so we never directly interacted with another shift. (Day shift at main site, night shift at back up site) We were all on call 24/7 and any PTO had to be approved by higher ups, we had to tell them why we needed off and were not allowed to travel.

Some rural areas that can't maintain volunteer fire departments for whatever reason are even doing 48 hour shifts for career firefighters; the FFs get to make the long commute from a city they live in fewer times. It works because most areas 10pm - 6am tends be less than 20% of their total calls. Bit busier on Friday and Saturday overnights, I suspect Tuesday nights are universally the slowest of the week (just based on personal experience :)) Busy cities? Some do...but f- that. I wouldn't want to be an employer asking folks to do that, I wouldn't want to be a patient. If the city maintains a consistent number of ambulances across all shifts, you might have a chance to snooze at night (again, overnight is generally slower); but if they do any kind of predictive staffing and cut back the number of units overnight your chance of getting rest goes to zilch. ]"

Hello, Reddit! I’m Dr. Howard Tucker and I have been practicing medicine since 1947, specifically neurology. I celebrated my 101st birthday earlier this month. After serving in the U.S. Navy during WWII, I graduated from medical school and began training at hospitals in Ohio and New York. I would later serve as Chief of Neurology for the Atlantic Fleet during the Korean War, and ultimately returned to Ohio where I’ve been practicing neurology for the last seven decades. My job gives me great satisfaction and it has been an honor getting to serve my patients and teach the next generation of neurologists.

But for those who like working and like their job, reasons for retiring diminish. In the end, a job can give purpose which can give satisfaction.

Most crimes require prosecutors to prove means, motive, and opportunity for any crime. The Alabama statute that Emma was charged for doesn't require any proof of fraudulent intent. Is this normal for false reporting statutes across the country? Did you consider including this flaw in the criminal codes as a contributing factor for the problem in the documentary? Prosecutors would struggle to convince a jury that these women stood anything to gain by filing false police reports, particularly against unknown subjects. The Netflix documentary Unbelievable depicted the story of Marie Adler and the Washington/Colorado serial rape cases. I was hoping to see some reference to it but understand you had to make hard choices with the time you had. Was there a reason you didn't include a reference to it in your documentary? It's the most appalling instance of police investigating victims that I'm aware of. What was a case you wanted to discuss most on the documentary but couldn't, for whatever reason? ]"

"What techniques do police employ that make it more or less likely for a victim to be found credible, or to be challenged and end up recanting?","[238&&RevealNews&& Another great question. First and foremost - victims should know that they have the right to attorney and an advocate in the room with them. Many times the victim was alone with law enforcement, with no indication that they were becoming a suspect.“Credibility” is subjective, but as we learned from Ret. Detective Carl Hershman, if a young person has been drinking, they might debunk them as credible (although - law enforcement should keep in mind that if a person is incapacitated they can not consent, and not weaponize a victims’ drinking against them).Another lack of “credibility” in the bias against victims can be “inconsistencies” or perceived inconsistencies in a victim’s memory or story.

"I always hear about right to attorney, but how does one excessive that right when they don’t know an attorney and are put in this position or others like breathalyzers, traffic stops, search, etc","[104&&RevealNews&& (Rae) Great question. If you are arrested, all you say is “I want an attorney” and police have to stop questioning you and provide you with an attorney. If you are not under arrest, then it is up to you to find an attorney. However, if you’re a victim, some departments must provide you with an advocate. They cannot and should not provide legal advice, but they are there to support you emotionally. You might find the Know Your Rights Camp helpful: https://kaepernick7.com/pages/know-your-rights-camp#:~:text=Know%20Your%20Rights%20Camp%20is,KNOW%20YOUR%20RIGHTS%20CAMP%20HERE! ]"
"I always hear about right to attorney, but how does one excessive that right when they don’t know an attorney and are put in this position or others like breathalyzers, traffic stops, search, etc","[10&&randomaccount178&& It generally goes together with another right that you have, the right to remain silent. In those other contexts a lawyer would be of limited use I believe. A lawyer is more likely to matter afterwards for those things rather then during. The only advice they could probably give you is to not volunteer anything either in a search or a traffic stop. ]"
"I always hear about right to attorney, but how does one excessive that right when they don’t know an attorney and are put in this position or others like breathalyzers, traffic stops, search, etc","[2&&Nose-Nuggets&& Your question has a few caveats. When driving and suspected of driving under the influence in the US, you don't have a right to an attorney yet. The right to an attorney comes with the being questioned pursuant to the committing of a crime portion outside of the vehicle code. You, as far as i understand it, sign away these rights when you accept a drivers license. An officer, in most states anyway, can pull you over and demand your identification, demand you out of the vehicle. They can also demand you perform tests (walk in a straight line, follow my pen with your eyes) if they have probable cause to suspect you driving under the influence (smell intoxicants from you or the vehicle, slurred speech, etc). Granted, you are well within you right to refuse these, but you will almost certainly be immediately arrested and taken to jail. You do not have the ability to refuse to produce ID, refuse to get out of the car, or refuse the tests 'until your lawyer arrives'. In some states (i think Florida?) if you refuse to take the sobriety tests at the scene it's an immediate revocation of your driving privileges for 6-12 months. generally once placed under arrest the officer reads you your Miranda rights before they start asking questions where your answers may implicate you in a criminal act. there are some specific instances where mirandizing before questioning is not required, but i think these very by state in some regard. ]"

"Hey Professor! Just kinda stumbled onto this AMA and as an engineering student I've always been fascinated on the prospects of AI in industry and medicine.

Do you think that this issue will be solved in the near future or is this something that will always be a struggle for researchers and developers?","[46&&ramaling1&& Modern day AI learns extensively from data. If the data used to train AI systems is not of good quality, the decisions made by the AI systems may not be accurate. In the good old days, AI relied on domain knowledge. We need to integrate domain knowledge and data so that the decisions are more accurate. The other issue I worry about is the vulnerability of AI systems to adversarial attacks. Researchers are actively working on these issues. Like any technology, AI will slowly and surely get better. ]"

Now AI systems are designed using data. The deep learning approach that is driving AI these days, basically fits a non-linear hierarchical regression model to data. This approach and new variations are giving very good results on many applications of AI (computer vision, NLP, robotics, etc). When domain knowledge is integrated into data-driven methods, we can comfortable be in the AI world again! ]"

I also live in Berlin, Germany 🙂.One of the biggest challenges in my life was to find my own balance between being there for others and being there for myself. So let me first tell you a bit about myself...When I grew up, I found myself extremely sensitive to outer circumstances, the world seemed too loud and fast at times. This often filled me with rage.I remember once having a discussion with my mom and totally shutting myself down. I just went into my shell, isolating myself from my strong emotions. I felt lonely and desperate and didn't know how to deal with this. It was a deeply unsettling experience!Over time I realized that when I started to draw, I could slow down and reduce the overload. This helped me to stay grounded and in the present. I thus started doing art to balance my emotions. It was beautiful to experience this inner resource and being able to help myself in a way I couldn't before!As I got older, I began enjoying understanding what drives and motivates people; particularly around their wellbeing. What I loved the most when I worked for my dad, a psychiatrist, was writing the documentation of his patient's stories, causes for their wellbeing, problems, suffering and ways to deal with it.I also loved talking to people, as every individual has their own story to tell. This also made me realize how beautiful it can be to share emotions and what tremendous growth this can unleash.Combining art with therapy seemed the direction to go, but a few people, including my dad discouraged me: ""You will neither find a job nor earn money!"".That triggered a deep insecurity for me and made me question the quality of my art, proof of which was needed when applying to study Art Therapy. I thus began studying social work, yet after a couple of weeks realized - ""this wasn't it"". It simply didn't feel right. So, I mustered the courage to do what felt right, applied to study art therapy, and GOT IN!After my graduation, I worked with elders in senior homes, children in psychiatric settings, adults, and children in refugee shelters in Germany & Greece.I lived the life I wanted to live, enjoyed my autonomy, my work, and fell in love with the most beautiful man I've ever met.When my daughter was born, I found myself struggling a lot with my inner world. Suddenly all the balance I had created for myself was gone: I had to be there for my daughter, no matter what, and all the space I needed for myself was gone.My brother was one of the biggest supporters (back then): He had started his own organization teaching people emotional competence and invited me to help him build the organization.Besides taking care of my daughter, I started taking over responsibility in running an organization. I could bring in my creativity, ideas, and knowledge from my previous work.As the program we created itself focuses on inner work, I worked with different tools like meditation, breathwork, and art (therapeutic techniques), while still being able to spend time with my family. Nevertheless, it was an intense period: building an organization AND raising a child at the same time is quite the tightrope walk! It was a beautiful period of growth and learning.Today as a co-founder of the organization Samana, I empower people to become more emotionally balanced, using art therapeutic tools, breathwork, and other contemplative and emotional tools.Why?

I thus began studying social work, yet after a couple of weeks realized - ""this wasn't it"". It simply didn't feel right. So, I mustered the courage to do what felt right, applied to study art therapy, and GOT IN!After my graduation, I worked with elders in senior homes, children in psychiatric settings, adults, and children in refugee shelters in Germany & Greece.I lived the life I wanted to live, enjoyed my autonomy, my work, and fell in love with the most beautiful man I've ever met.When my daughter was born, I found myself struggling a lot with my inner world. Suddenly all the balance I had created for myself was gone: I had to be there for my daughter, no matter what, and all the space I needed for myself was gone.My brother was one of the biggest supporters (back then): He had started his own organization teaching people emotional competence and invited me to help him build the organization.Besides taking care of my daughter, I started taking over responsibility in running an organization. I could bring in my creativity, ideas, and knowledge from my previous work.As the program we created itself focuses on inner work, I worked with different tools like meditation, breathwork, and art (therapeutic techniques), while still being able to spend time with my family. Nevertheless, it was an intense period: building an organization AND raising a child at the same time is quite the tightrope walk!

Do you have some connection with contemplative practice and what some people call non-duality?,"[2&&AdRemarkable9463&& Thanks for your question Madoc_eu.

That's interesting for me, because I'm currently planning on creating a German-language podcast (hallo übrigens!) on non-dualistic contemplative practice and insight free from religion or esotericism. The goal is not to teach people, but to make them interested, reach out to ""seekers"" and give them more context, so they can competently look for other sources and maybe teachers on their own. I feel like English sources and apps of high quality are abundant, but there is a gap for those who only understand German. After observing this gap for years and hoping for something to come along, I couldn't shake off the thought: Why shouldn't I help closing this gap more actively? What you are doing is interesting to me because it is therapeutic, whereas what I intend on making decidedly is not. So you must have a different view on things, and different practical approaches. But having seen the impressions video on your homepage, it's obvious that there is a huge, huge overlap. My personal ""elevator pitch"" style short version of the goal is: Make your life a vivid expression of your love for life. Looking at your video, I sense a strong resonance. So, quite interesting! Let me say hello to you from the heart, and I wish you lots of inspiration and success in helping others. ]"

Compared to LitterRobot, ours will be more concise and convenient to clean, you don't need to take part any things. Just simply lift up the globe case and wash it with a tap since there is no electrical component inside it. The Aimicat Pro uses a millimeter-wave radar sensor to detect cats’ motion. It will be safer for cats, during the device's operation. If a cat/person/other objects enter the safety range (7.9 inch/20 cm from the entrance of the global case), the device will pause for safety. What’s more, there is a sensor under the machine base and near the opening of the dumping litter tray, to use to detect if there are some unexpected objects that get stuck in the opening, as well as for waste bin full notification. Last but not least, our cats love to use it more than other automatic litter (we have purchased other brands for our cats to use, including the litter robot3.) ]"

I have been able to catch a few health issues simply by noting changes in poo, amount and frequency of urination, smell of urine, etc. (One of my cats was borderline diabetic which I only caught when I realized she was peeing a lot and it was super stinky.) Even if you have multiple cats and cannot identify exactly who is having the issue, you at least know to begin the process to determine that. Examining a tray of week old poop is of no value. Second, while you don't have to scoop every day, you do have to clean the globe on a not-infrequent basis.

PROOF: https://i.redd.it/5khsnlcsalcb1.jpg (edited to fix formatting)","[133&&losangelestimes&& J. Esco was working as a computer technician in Florida when Fereidoun “Prince Fred” Khalilian hired him for a repair job in 2009. He was soon working full time for Khalilian. His lavish lifestyle impressed Esco. His boss ran in celebrity circles; he had helped open Paris Hilton’s short-lived nightclub in Orlando, Fla. For a year, Esco ran IT for Khalilian’s robocall company while helping his boss launch a social media music company. That came to an abrupt end when federal agents raided Khalilian’s office in 2010, resulting in a 2010 Federal Trade Commission lawsuit alleging that Khalilian misrepresented car warranties to unsuspecting customers. Khalilian and his company were ordered to pay a $4.2-million judgment in the case. After the raid, the company shut down and Esco was out of work. Esco said his former boss promised to help him get back on his feet. “In my mind I was like, ‘F— this, I’ll never talk to this guy again.’” A few years later, Esco moved to Los Angeles to try his hand in the entertainment industry. He cobbled together a living in Hollywood, but he was always on the lookout for the big project that might catapult him into more marquee work. Then, he reconnected with Khalilian on set, according to Esco. As they spoke, Esco had an idea. He could make a documentary about his onetime boss — a high-rolling socialite with a shadowy background. Esco said he went home and Googled Khalilian and found articles about scandals involving the businessman spanning nearly two decades, with allegations including battery, extortion and “threats of mutilation, death and threats to family.” Khalilian has defended himself in court, arguing that allegations made against him in lawsuits and criminal cases were false. He has been ordered to pay settlements in some cases and pleaded no contest to lesser charges in criminal proceedings. Esco thought the documentary could be his big break, but only if he could get Khalilian to participate. He came up with an unorthodox solution in the practice of documentary film: He would lie to his subject. To gain Khalilian’s trust, Esco promised the film would cast him in a favorable light. Khalilian explained his extravagant wealth by telling people he was an Arab prince — though his national origin changed depending on whom he was talking to, prosecutors and family said. It wasn’t until about a decade ago that he began referring to himself as “Prince Fred,” Khalilian’s first cousin Paradis Khalilian told The Times. She said he has no royalty background. His background is Persian, not Arabic, said his cousin. He was born in Iran and moved to Turkey when he was 12, then Germany when he was 13 and eventually the United States when he turned 18, she said. Esco spent four days interviewing Khalilian, gathering his subject’s version of his life story. Khalilian seemed more interested in a Kardashian-style reality show than a documentary, Esco said. “He wanted me to ask him as he got out of the car at the club, ‘How’d you lose so much weight?’ ” Esco said. The ruse could go on only so long. A source whom Esco approached about an interview tipped off Khalilian, Esco said. Now he knew the real direction of the film — and he wasn’t happy about it. Mike Sherwood, who worked as the head of Khalilian’s security team, said he had no plans to resort to violence when he traveled to Los Angeles to speak with Esco — he hoped to talk the filmmaker out of making the documentary. Esco showed Sherwood parts of the documentary about Khalilian and asked if the bodyguard would be open to an interview for the project, Esco said. Sherwood agreed and was filmed in June 2022, though he continued to work for Khalilian. He said he spoke of the “positive and negative” sides of Khalilian in his interview and informed his employer that he had talked with Esco. For a time, Khalilian appeared less bothered by Esco, Sherwood said. Then Esco began making calls to his former boss. He started to goad Khalilian, calling from spoofed numbers and saying nothing other than “habibi” — an affectionate address in Arabic — or “Fred,” and hoping that Khalilian would lose his temper, prosecutors said. Esco would record the calls. He called Khalilian about 20 times in early March 2023, according to prosecutors. Esco said he hoped Khalilian might make threats that he could record and use in the documentary. And Khalilian did, according to the criminal complaint and audio recordings reviewed by The Times. “When I’m done with you, I’m going to cut each one of your f—ing fingers off,” Khalilian said on one recorded call on March 8, according to a transcript in the complaint. “I’m going to f— you up, b—. I’m going to have your f—ing head.” In March, Khalilian solicited Sherwood to have Esco killed for $20,000, a federal agent wrote in the criminal complaint. When Esco woke up on March 17, he saw he had missed a text from Sherwood: “Call me when you can.” When Esco called back, Sherwood said, he filled him in on the whole arrangement. The two hatched a plan so crazy it just might work: a faked murder, more high school film project than Hollywood motion picture. Esco’s girlfriend would take a photo of the crime scene. Then they would send the photo to Sherwood, who would turn it over to Khalilian as proof Esco was dead. Sherwood passed along one of the images of the staged killing to Khalilian, according to prosecutors. He told Khalilian that he had hired a group of Mexicans to carry out the murder and that they buried Esco in a warehouse in Los Angeles, according to Sherwood and prosecutors. Within a minute, Khalilian sent $3,000 to Sherwood on Cash App from the account @$PrinceFredKhalilian, prosecutors said. All in all, Khalilian paid Sherwood a total of $12,500 for the faked killing, according to the criminal complaint. At this point, Esco and Sherwood still had not contacted law enforcement. Sherwood wanted to wait longer to go, he said. He believed Esco was in no real danger because Khalilian thought he was dead — and Sherwood hoped to continue collecting the payment for the killing, he said. Instead, Esco went to The Times with his story. He then went to the FBI. The agents were interested. But before making an arrest, they wanted Khalilian to admit he had ordered a killing, Sherwood said. The FBI told him to stay off the grid, Esco said. Meanwhile, the FBI was keeping Sherwood busy. Sherwood recorded calls between himself and Khalilian and sent evidence of the cash payments from his phone, according to the complaint. He had to screen-shot all of his communications with Khalilian and share them with agents, Sherwood said. On June 21, Sherwood opened the door of his Porsche Macan and prepared to put on the most important performance of his life. Khalilian got into the car and the two men went for a drive around Las Vegas. Federal agents had slipped a camera into the Dodgers hat on the dashboard, feeding sound and video directly to law enforcement, Sherwood said. He showed Khalilian the belongings of Esco the FBI had given him — Esco’s passport, IDs, his Global Entry pass.The belongings were further evidence, along with the staged photo, for Khalilian that the deed had been done. As they sat in the car, Khalilian opened up, Sherwood said. “If I didn’t pay you to do it, I was going to kill him myself,” Khalilian said, according to Sherwood. The FBI would not share its recording of the conversation, but it did not dispute Sherwood’s retelling. Agents surrounded the two and arrested Khalilian. Prosecutors charged him with murder for hire for the plot to kill Esco and the payments he made to Sherwood. A federal magistrate judge in Nevada ordered Khalilian held without bond on June 26. He faces up to 10 years in prison. “Mr. Khalilian maintains his innocence and looks forward to defending himself in court,” said his attorneys, David Chesnoff and Richard Schonfeld. “The actions of the government witnesses surely need to be examined; however, it would be inappropriate to make any further comment at this time.” His attorneys argued in court that Khalilian should be released pretrial. “While counsel understands that the charges are serious and that the government will assert that it has evidence in support of the charges, all remaining factors weigh strongly in favor of Mr. Khalilian being released,” Chesnoff wrote. His attorneys also said Khalilian has no felony criminal history and has “tremendous family support.” ]"

What do you feel Sherwood's motivation was in working with Esco? Both in the documentary and then in faking Esco's death?,"[41&&losangelestimes&& That's an interesting question. Sherwood is definitely the most ambiguous of the three when it comes to motivations. He met with Esco at Khalilian's behest originally to try to convince Esco to stop making the documentary. He told me he had no interest in hurting Esco at that time. He liked Esco when they met. When Esco asked him to participate he saw no issue. Sherwood does what he wants, is my sense. If he feels like participating in a doc, he'll do it. He said he was honest about Khalilian's personality, which he saw as up and down, with very low lows. He even told Khalilian about participating, he told me. Sherwood told me he never had any plans to kill Esco and that he took on the role of hit man so that Khalilian didn't either a. kill Esco himself or b. hire somebody else to kill Esco. ALSO, as Sherwood told me, he had no issue raking in the murder payments from Khalilian despite Esco still being alive. He even wanted Esco to delay going to the feds so he could continue taking in the CashApp payments that Khalilian was sending him, he told me. I see Sherwood as a bit of a loose cannon. He's willing to do some stuff that might be dicey, but he ultimately drew the line at murder and decided to inform Esco instead of going through with it. Once he was hired as the ""hitman"" I believe Sherwood's view of Khalilian changed. He saw Khalilian as dangerous and was willing to fake the murder to help get Khalilian caught. Also, Khalilian had asked Sherwood for ""proof"" that Esco had been killed, so they needed to do something. -Noah Goldberg ]"
How is it he's only facing a possible 10 years for a murder-for-hire plot? Does Esco fear for his life with his attempted murderer receiving such a short sentence?,"[27&&losangelestimes&& 10 years is the maximum federal sentence for murder for hire (when there is no injury to the intended victim, like in this case. https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1107-murder-hire-offense I think Esco is more comfortable now that Khalilian is being held in jail pre-trial. He definitely felt a weight off his back. he hasn't said that he feels the sentence is short to me. Also, worth noting, Khalilian, if convicted, could get less than 10 years. -Noah Goldberg ]"
"J. Esco was working as a computer technician in Florida when Fereidoun “Prince Fred” Khalilian hired him for a repair job in 2009. He was soon working full time for Khalilian. His lavish lifestyle impressed Esco. His boss ran in celebrity circles; he had helped open Paris Hilton’s short-lived nightclub in Orlando, Fla. For a year, Esco ran IT for Khalilian’s robocall company while helping his boss launch a social media music company. That came to an abrupt end when federal agents raided Khalilian’s office in 2010, resulting in a 2010 Federal Trade Commission lawsuit alleging that Khalilian misrepresented car warranties to unsuspecting customers. Khalilian and his company were ordered to pay a $4.2-million judgment in the case. After the raid, the company shut down and Esco was out of work. Esco said his former boss promised to help him get back on his feet. “In my mind I was like, ‘F— this, I’ll never talk to this guy again.’” A few years later, Esco moved to Los Angeles to try his hand in the entertainment industry. He cobbled together a living in Hollywood, but he was always on the lookout for the big project that might catapult him into more marquee work. Then, he reconnected with Khalilian on set, according to Esco. As they spoke, Esco had an idea. He could make a documentary about his onetime boss — a high-rolling socialite with a shadowy background. Esco said he went home and Googled Khalilian and found articles about scandals involving the businessman spanning nearly two decades, with allegations including battery, extortion and “threats of mutilation, death and threats to family.” Khalilian has defended himself in court, arguing that allegations made against him in lawsuits and criminal cases were false. He has been ordered to pay settlements in some cases and pleaded no contest to lesser charges in criminal proceedings. Esco thought the documentary could be his big break, but only if he could get Khalilian to participate. He came up with an unorthodox solution in the practice of documentary film: He would lie to his subject. To gain Khalilian’s trust, Esco promised the film would cast him in a favorable light. Khalilian explained his extravagant wealth by telling people he was an Arab prince — though his national origin changed depending on whom he was talking to, prosecutors and family said. It wasn’t until about a decade ago that he began referring to himself as “Prince Fred,” Khalilian’s first cousin Paradis Khalilian told The Times. She said he has no royalty background. His background is Persian, not Arabic, said his cousin. He was born in Iran and moved to Turkey when he was 12, then Germany when he was 13 and eventually the United States when he turned 18, she said. Esco spent four days interviewing Khalilian, gathering his subject’s version of his life story. Khalilian seemed more interested in a Kardashian-style reality show than a documentary, Esco said. “He wanted me to ask him as he got out of the car at the club, ‘How’d you lose so much weight?’ ” Esco said. The ruse could go on only so long. A source whom Esco approached about an interview tipped off Khalilian, Esco said. Now he knew the real direction of the film — and he wasn’t happy about it. Mike Sherwood, who worked as the head of Khalilian’s security team, said he had no plans to resort to violence when he traveled to Los Angeles to speak with Esco — he hoped to talk the filmmaker out of making the documentary. Esco showed Sherwood parts of the documentary about Khalilian and asked if the bodyguard would be open to an interview for the project, Esco said. Sherwood agreed and was filmed in June 2022, though he continued to work for Khalilian. He said he spoke of the “positive and negative” sides of Khalilian in his interview and informed his employer that he had talked with Esco. For a time, Khalilian appeared less bothered by Esco, Sherwood said. Then Esco began making calls to his former boss. He started to goad Khalilian, calling from spoofed numbers and saying nothing other than “habibi” — an affectionate address in Arabic — or “Fred,” and hoping that Khalilian would lose his temper, prosecutors said. Esco would record the calls. He called Khalilian about 20 times in early March 2023, according to prosecutors. Esco said he hoped Khalilian might make threats that he could record and use in the documentary. And Khalilian did, according to the criminal complaint and audio recordings reviewed by The Times. “When I’m done with you, I’m going to cut each one of your f—ing fingers off,” Khalilian said on one recorded call on March 8, according to a transcript in the complaint. “I’m going to f— you up, b—. I’m going to have your f—ing head.” In March, Khalilian solicited Sherwood to have Esco killed for $20,000, a federal agent wrote in the criminal complaint. When Esco woke up on March 17, he saw he had missed a text from Sherwood: “Call me when you can.” When Esco called back, Sherwood said, he filled him in on the whole arrangement. The two hatched a plan so crazy it just might work: a faked murder, more high school film project than Hollywood motion picture. Esco’s girlfriend would take a photo of the crime scene. Then they would send the photo to Sherwood, who would turn it over to Khalilian as proof Esco was dead. Sherwood passed along one of the images of the staged killing to Khalilian, according to prosecutors. He told Khalilian that he had hired a group of Mexicans to carry out the murder and that they buried Esco in a warehouse in Los Angeles, according to Sherwood and prosecutors. Within a minute, Khalilian sent $3,000 to Sherwood on Cash App from the account @$PrinceFredKhalilian, prosecutors said. All in all, Khalilian paid Sherwood a total of $12,500 for the faked killing, according to the criminal complaint. At this point, Esco and Sherwood still had not contacted law enforcement. Sherwood wanted to wait longer to go, he said. He believed Esco was in no real danger because Khalilian thought he was dead — and Sherwood hoped to continue collecting the payment for the killing, he said. Instead, Esco went to The Times with his story. He then went to the FBI. The agents were interested. But before making an arrest, they wanted Khalilian to admit he had ordered a killing, Sherwood said. The FBI told him to stay off the grid, Esco said. Meanwhile, the FBI was keeping Sherwood busy. Sherwood recorded calls between himself and Khalilian and sent evidence of the cash payments from his phone, according to the complaint. He had to screen-shot all of his communications with Khalilian and share them with agents, Sherwood said. On June 21, Sherwood opened the door of his Porsche Macan and prepared to put on the most important performance of his life. Khalilian got into the car and the two men went for a drive around Las Vegas. Federal agents had slipped a camera into the Dodgers hat on the dashboard, feeding sound and video directly to law enforcement, Sherwood said. He showed Khalilian the belongings of Esco the FBI had given him — Esco’s passport, IDs, his Global Entry pass.The belongings were further evidence, along with the staged photo, for Khalilian that the deed had been done. As they sat in the car, Khalilian opened up, Sherwood said. “If I didn’t pay you to do it, I was going to kill him myself,” Khalilian said, according to Sherwood. The FBI would not share its recording of the conversation, but it did not dispute Sherwood’s retelling. Agents surrounded the two and arrested Khalilian. Prosecutors charged him with murder for hire for the plot to kill Esco and the payments he made to Sherwood. A federal magistrate judge in Nevada ordered Khalilian held without bond on June 26. He faces up to 10 years in prison. “Mr. Khalilian maintains his innocence and looks forward to defending himself in court,” said his attorneys, David Chesnoff and Richard Schonfeld. “The actions of the government witnesses surely need to be examined; however, it would be inappropriate to make any further comment at this time.” His attorneys argued in court that Khalilian should be released pretrial. “While counsel understands that the charges are serious and that the government will assert that it has evidence in support of the charges, all remaining factors weigh strongly in favor of Mr. Khalilian being released,” Chesnoff wrote. His attorneys also said Khalilian has no felony criminal history and has “tremendous family support.”",[58&&FeeeFiiFooFumm&& This is by far one of the most fascinating stories I've read in a long time.

Does Esco intended to finish his film project? Is it still considered ongoing? How has Esco reacted to all this from what you can tell? Your article presents multiple moments where Esco dives deeper to get more material and enhance his story rather than disentangle himself from his subject. That doesn't strike me as the actions of someone who was truly concerned for his well being. How have your interactions with him struck you?,"[16&&losangelestimes&& Esco has always intended to finish his project. All of his engagement with Khalilian, the goading and the spoofed phone calls he made, were meant to elicit a reaction from Khalilian that Esco could record and use for his documentary, he told me. I think the scrutiny and his becoming such a focal part of the story — which he always saw as a documentary about Khalilian — has been difficult for him. It was hard for him to let us take photos. He is very used to being behind the camera, and less comfortable being in front of it, he said. But he really wanted to get his story out there. While I know Esco is concerned for his well-being and was very nervous about the alleged murder for hire plot, he is obviously a risk taker as well. To me, he is someone who is very excited about a project and extremely committed to it. He has a frenetic, high-paced energy and seems to think about nothing besides Khalilian and the project. That said, he was afraid. He was concerned that it took the FBI so long (about 3 months) to arrest Khalilian after he made the complaint. He didn't like the idea that the man who allegedly wanted him dead was roaming the streets. -Noah Goldberg ]"

And it may be true that the founders regarded the construction of the court as “countermajoritarian”, to use your word, just as they did the electoral college. I don’t like that, but it may be the case. It also feels short sighted in a way- younger justices and term limits would swing the court to the left in obvious ways but that may not actually have a long shelf life. How do you make a case to people on the right that this is a good idea? And how do you make the case to the left that it’s good for us in the long term?

Why 18 years?,"[14&&TheBrennanCenter&& Mathematically, if there are 18-year terms and a 9-justice court, then we can have a regular system where a new justice rotates into the Court every 2 years. That regular system is really important, because one of the problems we see now is that presidents have had really different imprints on the Court. President Trump appointed three justices in a 4-year term, while Presidents Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama each appointed only 2 justices in 8 years. President Carter didn’t get any Supreme Court appointments at all! More generally, though, we think something in the vicinity of 18 years is the right length – long enough for a justice to have an impact and become experienced at the job, and also not so long that an individual justice holds the seat for an entire generation. It is also more like the way the Supreme Court operated for most of the nation’s history; for the first 180 years of U.S. history, justices served for an average of 15 years. It’s only recently that justices’ terms have ballooned – several current justices are on track to serve through 9 presidential terms. 18-year terms brings the court back to the way it has historically worked. ]"

President Trump appointed three justices in a 4-year term, while Presidents Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama each appointed only 2 justices in 8 years. President Carter didn’t get any Supreme Court appointments at all! More generally, though, we think something in the vicinity of 18 years is the right length – long enough for a justice to have an impact and become experienced at the job, and also not so long that an individual justice holds the seat for an entire generation. It is also more like the way the Supreme Court operated for most of the nation’s history; for the first 180 years of U.S. history, justices served for an average of 15 years. It’s only recently that justices’ terms have ballooned – several current justices are on track to serve through 9 presidential terms. 18-year terms brings the court back to the way it has historically worked.",[5&&IllThinkOfOneLater&& Why not add a minimum age for appointees? Wouldn’t that be more in line with the way the court historically worked? ]
"I’m a democrat but I regard this proposal as beneficial to our side in a way that feels concerning. You state elsewhere that Republican presidents have been able to disproportionately seat justices- but the same could be true for us in the future. Just as McConnell’s interpretation of Advise and Consent and Bush v Gore reinforced the republican sway of the court, I actually think these dynamics are party agnostic- democrats could have done the same things with our own majorities. And it may be true that the founders regarded the construction of the court as “countermajoritarian”, to use your word, just as they did the electoral college. I don’t like that, but it may be the case. It also feels short sighted in a way- younger justices and term limits would swing the court to the left in obvious ways but that may not actually have a long shelf life. How do you make a case to people on the right that this is a good idea? And how do you make the case to the left that it’s good for us in the long term?

Do they lean more to the middle, or to the extreme? Or stay the same? Does age bring wisdom or extremism? Maybe it depends on the person? And do those decisions, regardless of their popularity, improve the health of the country? I like some of RBG and Kennedy’s decisions from their old years, but I also detest some of Thomas’.

"[438&&MikeHutchinson&&POST=[xpost] Call me Hutch, I am a rural progressive veteran running for the Minnesota State House, District 20b. Please Ask Me Anything.] Hi, I'm Michael Hutchinson, please call me Hutch. I'm a patriot, a veteran, and a progressive. I launched my campaign for the Minnesota State House District 20b in April of this year. I grew up poor and enlisted in the U.S. Army after high school. I served on active duty and in the National Guard, using the GI Bill to earn a degree in managerial marketing from Kent State. I've been employed as a marketer for 14 years and I currently work remotely as an operations manager from my home in Zumbrota. I've been happily married for almost a decade, and my wife and I share our lives with two dogs and two birds. I reside in a stunning region of river bluffs and lush farmland, but like many rural areas in America, my neighbors often feel neglected by our government. This sense of neglect breeds anger, providing fertile ground for hate and fear to thrive. Unfortunately, this anger has been fueled by a long line of self-serving politicians who stoke the belief that the government is not working for us. After every election they prove our neighbors right by favoring their friends and corporate donors in legislation or by spending their time making political soundbites, all while disregarding the needs of the people and their districts. We must break this cycle. In my district, we currently have an unacceptable child poverty rate of around 10%. To make matters worse, our state senator recently made national headlines by claiming he had never met a hungry child in our district. This lack of awareness comes as no surprise since he rarely engages with the people or businesses in our district, unless there's a stage, a microphone and some cameras. My opponent in the State House shares his sentiment; they both voted against feeding children. This was the final straw that compelled me to step up and try to provide actual representation for my neighbors. When I am elected I will focus on issues that most directly affect rural communities. I break these down into four main categories: Food and Water Security, Affordable Housing, Sustainable Family Farms + Homesteads, and Education Funding. In addition to my main priorities, I will support any changes to our first-past-the-post voting system that can introduce more nuanced and diverse representation. And because we should all have an odd position, I advocate for the abolition of Daylight Savings Time. You can find more details about me and my views on my website: vote4hutch.com Thank you for taking the time to learn about me and my campaign. I'm here to answer any questions you may have! Ask me anything. This AMA post was originally made in r/Political_Revolution. Feel free to join the conversation there!","[0&&AutoModerator&& Hello!

There is a such a huge price range available out there. Is the more expensive herb worth it? Why? Thanks!,"[5&&mike_is_stoned&& You’re right, there’s a huge price range! Quality is one part: Flower with a harsh burn or a less appealing flavor would usually go on sale, while herb that’s been grown organically, that has a unique and strong flavor, or a smooth and gentle burn could justify a higher price point. That being said, profit margins play into this as well. If a company overproduces a strain with a larger than average harvest, they may lower the price and thus their margins to liquidate it while it’s still fresh. The opposite is true too though- something that’s hard to grow and has a smaller than average harvest may need to be sold at a higher price point to be profitable. Hope this helped! ]"

Is it true that weed can help chronic pain?,"[1&&mike_is_stoned&& Yes and no. Cannabis can’t heal the source of the pain on its own, and thus can’t eliminate chronic pain in its entirety. Cannabis can, however, greatly reduce inflammation and pain intensity caused by a variety of ailments, ranging from fibromyalgia and severe arthritis to muscle tension and injuries. My personal favorite cannabinoid, or active cannabis compound, for pain management is CBDA (Cannabidiolic Acid)! It works very similarly to an NSAID, yet targets the enzyme responsible for that nasty stomach lining side effect of NSAID’s approximately 9x less- making it safe for daily use :) ]"

"Hey, looks great. I’m new to crypto and curious to hear what makes Tezos different to other blockchains. And what does your day to day work look like in crypto?","[0&&DeFiMikey&& Hi MarketmayThanks for your message. What makes Tezos different - Tezos is a self-amendment chain with emphasis on on-chain governance and formal verification. On-chain governance allows Tezos to be upgraded without having to split the network into two different Blockchains (known as hard forks) as seen with Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. This prevents a split in community, liquidity and activity. The smart contracts on Tezos can be written with the Michelson language which facilitates formal verification. I shared a link describing formal verification but it is a mathematical technique that adds an extra layer of security to the transactions carried out on the network. Finally, the consensus mechanism is based on liquid proof of stake. Any user can become a baker (validator) if they have enough XTZ. If they don't have sufficient XTZ, they have the choice to delegate. Sharing a list of bakers for you to see! On my day to day, as I am focused on partnerships, I spend most of my time working with existing projects that have integrated Tezos and identifying new Trader-centric projects that would fit our vision at Trilitech. I try to be as accessible as possible for projects and to be a conduit between them and the broader Trilitech teams. ]"

This prevents a split in community, liquidity and activity. This is misleading. Any blockchain project has the capacity to fork into a different version of the blockchain if enough people want to make changes and reject the current codebase in favor of something new that changes the structure of the blockchain making it incompatible with past versions. Any open source blockchain project can fork at any time. This is the nature of open source and blockchain. The smart contracts on Tezos can be written with the Michelson language which facilitates formal verification. I shared a link describing formal verification but it is a mathematical technique that adds an extra layer of security to the transactions carried out on the network. This is also misleading. Formal verification primarily pertains to mathematical computations. This won't protect from code vulnerabilities, back doors, or trojan horses. Finally, the consensus mechanism is based on liquid proof of stake. Any user can become a baker (validator) if they have enough XTZ. If they don't have sufficient XTZ, they have the choice to delegate. Sharing a list of bakers for you to see! This is not any fundamentally different from most other blockchain-based consensus mechanisms. Whoever pays the most, or whoever owns the most tokens, controls consensus. What you should be revealing is the total distribution of the tokens. Does the dev team control so many tokens that they can always push through whatever ""consensus-based"" changes they want? That's almost always the case with these projects. The whole notion of ""consensus"" in crypto is basically a farce when early adopters control so many tokens, the only way to offset that is to buy a ton of tokens - making the early adopters rich AF in order to influence the network. It's a catch-22. ]"
"Though the idea of DeFi has loads of potential, most (if not all) DeFi web apps seem nothing more than a game of ""casino musical chairs."" What's the plan to make DeFi innovations a game-changer for financing productive enterprises?","[1&&DeFiMikey&& Hi gui_eurig. So it depends on what you see as casino musical chairs. Often when I hear this, it is referring to a project using its token to bootstrap users and liquidity. Once these token incentive dry up or are no longer attractive: liquidity, users and activity moves to another project and the musical chairs continue.This is where I believe real yield becomes important. If a platform has a strong market fit with high usage, the fees made from this activity are used to incentivise users and liquidity providers (instead of relying on a projects inflationary token). Thereby the yield that is generated is more sustainable and reduces the flight risk from one platform to another.As for DeFi financing productive enterprises, this is a good question. Lets think of what an enterprise would need to move to DeFi over the traditional means. They would need a better or on par interest rate and repayment term, lower fees charged good reputation of the lender (help with the loan, change payment plan etc) Smart contracts can definitely make the process more efficient which is important but I think more work needs to go into understanding several phases of the credit lifecycle for DeFi to be useful. The underwriting process (how the creditworthiness of the business is determined) and the recovery phase (how does one deal bad loans when in a decentralised fashion). I think with the evolution of 'Permissioned DeFi' we will see strides made into this space as KYC and compliance will be an important factor in these cases. ]"

Once a problem or pain-point is understood and an application or service solves for that need, adoption will be driven from those users. So, what drives DeFi adoption? It depends about which area of DeFi we are referring to (eg lending, trading, remittences, savings etc), but several general factors exist: Ownership - Users want control of their assets and to use them in a quick and cost effective manner (trade, take a loan, transfer etc). Financial inclusion - Simply connect your self-custodial wallet and interact with services and assets that may not be accessible in your location. This is for me the most 'sticky' driver for adoption as it's not about profiting but about wealth preservation. Innovation - I love that there is constant innovation and experimentation. I think that this is a big driver for current adoption: people see the evolution of new products and services and keep close to the products that solve a pain-point or are interesting for them. Financial Opportunities - Without a doubt, there is an element of searching for yield and profitable opportunities. This is also a big driver for DeFi users. So how do I think adoption will happen (continue to happen), I see growing activity on trading applications and projects that have a Trader-centric focus (eg GMX).

Hey there Michael! What infrastructure do you think is missing to help DeFi teams build faster? Any dapps you think are missing or would like to see expanded?,"[3&&DeFiMikey&& Hi onebalddude Firstly, a big thank you for your comment and I really appreciate our ongoing discussions. Let me answer your second question first as there are some similarities to keeyno. I would love to see an expansion of innovative Trader-centric applications and products. A Trader-centric approach aims to prioritise the needs and preferences of Traders. This covers a clean user interface but also the trading tools, features, charting and surrounding educational content to name a few. An increase in quality trading apps will result in good growth in users, TVL and transactions in my opinion which benefits the entire DeFi ecosystem on Tezos. On your first question, to build faster, I would say easily accessible open source code should be readily available so time and effort is not spent when a code base exists. Would love to hear your thoughts? Thanks! ]"

Talk to a qualified plastic surgeon, ideally a breast reconstruction person, about implant options. Complications are always possible but implant related illness is very rare with what's on the market now.

What makes a store decide to stop selling a product? It’s happened with so many products that I’ve really liked.,"[5&&arditk25&& This can happen due to a number of scenarios, so here are the most common that I dealt with: 1.) The company discontinues the product. In this case we would continue selling the remaining inventory until it ran out. This usually would then get replaced with another product from that company. 2.) In some cases a recall (This was extremely rare) used to lead to the discontinuation of a product. 3.) The majority of the customers weren’t buying the product. This was usually a money problem since if an item wasn’t selling, then there was no point in ordering it and keeping it on our inventory. People used to get mad when this happened, but my supervisor & I had no choice as it was an order from the management, since they didn’t want to lose money. 4.) The head company (In ShopRite’s case this is Wakefern) decided to remove the product from their shipment warehouse for any reason. The reason for this happening was above my pay grade and I never really asked why. Those were 4 of the main things that would happen with me when I worked there. Other people who work in retail might have different causes than mine depending on who you ask. Hope this answered your question! Note: At most stores a product being discontinued will have a special value price label (In ShopRite’s case it’s a green coloured tag). ]"

"From all the dishes you have cooked, what is one dish you would recommend everyone to try to cook?","[12&&BergerShot&& I really like this question - I'm going to answer generically and specifically. Specifically: Machboos for Bahrain, because it was my #1 overall. At its essence its a 'simple' chicken and rice dish, but the baharat spice blend is just out of control. All your C's - cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, coriander, cumin - plus turmeric for good measure. It really just exemplifies how incredible the use of spices are in middle eastern cooking. And its really not that hard - I made it early on and it was this bewildering moment of like ""Oh wow, I can actually make something thats very good!"" Generically: something you've never done before. I'm a pretty adventurous eater, but this has gotten me hundreds of things I haven't had before, and I love just about all of them. And there's still so much more I haven't had. I'm giving a shoutout to Nasi Lemak for Malaysia here: coconut rice, with garlic-onion-anchovy sauce, topped with things like toasted peanuts and fried anchovies. Never had anything like it before, and it comes together beautifully. ]"
"Knowing what you know now, if you could go back in time and give yourself advice (or a warning!) at the start of this endeavor, what would you say to your past self?","[8&&BergerShot&& Spend more time discovering Philly for local grocers. I had to online order my way through a couple things early on, which I've been gradually cutting out. The more I get to explore of my City the better, so I would have leaned on that more. Especially early on in the pandemic where the purchases would have been that more meaningful for these businesses. And taking more videos! I think I've gotten the hand of stitching these things together on social media, would have been cool to do that the whole way through. ]"
What were the most challenging dishes for you?,"[11&&BergerShot&& So a couple categories of difficulty - there was difficulty in procuring the ingredients, and difficulty in making the dish itself. For the ingredients, for the life of me i could not find mutton (Buuz for Mongolia). Literally had to go to NYC for that (I'm from Philly). I've covered a lot of ground at this point and know where to get just about everything, but some real speciality ingredients like Yete still elude me locally. For difficulty in cooking - believe it or not I knew very very little about cooking beforehand. So like with Pavlova for Australia, I didn't know that the eggs need to be room temp, and there can be NO oil in the bowl, and it can't be raining outside, and you need to make sure the eggs are feeling self-confident...needless to say I needed to do a second attempt on that one. A couple were tough in the formation - my Kuli Kuli for Benin really barely qualified. Same with cepelinai for Lithuania - these dumpling type things tend to fall apart for me. Oh and one more category - effort. The top two were Beshbarmak for Kazakhstan and La Bandera for Dominican Republic. I highly recommend both, but each one of those had sooo many different components it was a lot to put it all together. Amazing dishes though! I made edit this and think of more. ]"

Picking Pavlova as the Australian dish was a brave choice … it’s claimed by New Zealand too.,"[2&&BergerShot&& There was a lot of dishes I did that were really 'owned' by multiple countries. I originally had chosen to do the first dish listed in the Wikipedia page for 'national dish'. Eventually I decided to do a unique dish for each country, which meant I had to do a lot of redo's and alternative choices when it came to fufu, chicken moambe, gallo pinto, pilaf-plov, etc. So I ended up doing pavlova for australia and bacon and egg pie for new zealand, which i hope was reasonably representative of each. ]"
How much did you spend on the ingredients to cook every dish?,"[4&&BergerShot&& It definitely varied - and depended on how many people I was cooking for. All in, I probably saved money by doing this, because I shifted soooo much of my eating out budget to cooking at home. But when I had a dish that, say, needed crab (Chili Crab for Singapore) or Snapper (Kokoda for Fiji) it set me back a bit. Oh also lobster (Coconut Curry Lobster for Kiribati). But one thing I learned, some stuff is really cheap, like Mussels (Moules Frites for Belgium)! But a lot were really economical, staple pantry ingredients and the like. ]"
"Did you have to upgrade your equipment to execute certain recipes? If so, what's your favorite piece of kitchen equipment you acquired during this project?","[3&&BergerShot&& So I had next to nothing to start off. We're talking wine bottle instead of a rolling pin type of situation. Eventually that became unsustainable, and I acquired skewers, an immersion blender, spice grinder, mixer, cake tin, and yes, skewers. The number one would have to be the rice cooker - although many of the recipes I did, you need to do something specific with the rice so it wouldn't work in that equipment, the number of times I was wrapping up a recipe and suddenly ""Oh GODDAMNIT!! THE RICE!!"" was more times than I cared to admit. It just makes life so much easier. Also I wish I had whatever the things is that lets you fill sausages. When I did Verivost (blood sausage) for Estonia my kitchen ended up looking like a murder scene. ]"
That's fantastic! Did you ever think you were going to pick up the traction that you did? It sounds like an amazing journey.,"[3&&BergerShot&& To a certain extent, but its easy to doubt yourself at times, if I'm being honest. But I do have a tremendous amount of faith and confidence in CARE. I've been involved for about 15 years, every year a bit more immersed and was excited when I had the idea for this. They filled in most of the details, and provide all the necessary infrastructure to make sure my gift was leveraged. So like the rice challenge idea was all them. But yeah, I knew we were going to do something special with this journey when all was said and done. ]"

It is not unsafe to swallow tiny amounts of your nasal spray that drip down the back of the throat. However, this does potentially increase the likelihood of developing certain side-effects such as nausea.

"Hello and thank you for your question. Whether to pursue a PhD might depend on what you envision to be the nature of your involvement in medicine and biomedical research - whether it is in private practice, a university setting or in the biotechnology sector. From a purely educational standpoint, pursuing a PhD tends to sharpen one's ability to analyze scientific research, the merit of new scientific discoveries and in general, refines the ability to analyze raw data and determine its potential clinical, and not solely its statistical, significance. I personally am quite grateful to have devoted time and effort toward a PhD and have found that doing so has enabled me in perpetuity to bring a higher level of scientific accuracy to the care of my patients, and to be able to formulate more-informed answers to my patients' many questions regarding diagnostic testing and pharmacotherapy.

"What do you think of SLIT Therapy for curing allergies? I've been battling post-nasal drip my entire life and cycled between zyrtec, claritin, allegra, etc with not much luck and Ive developed acid reflux in more recent years due to work/life stress. The combination has been destroying my vocal cords. I went to an ENT back in April for a checkup/diagnosis for more serious options and they examined my vocal cords - they said they were enflamed and my throat was ""cobbled"" and suggested a combo of Flonase, any common anti-allergy pill, and SLIT therapy after running an allergy test (surprise surprise, I'm allergic to just about every common environmental allergen at a 9 out of 10 severity). I've been diligently taking the drops for about two months now and am kinda bummed that this will take a few years to really see any progress.","[11&&stanfordallergist&& I am sorry to hear about this constellation of symptoms but do believe there is good help that can be given. First, with respect to acid reflux, the general approach is to use a good acid-inhibiting medication. For this, I generally turn to the proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), some of which work better than others and thus a trial of more than one member of the PPI category might be necessary. Response to treatment with PPI therapy can vary from days to weeks. This is joined by other lifestyle measures to limit acid reflux, including dietary modifications, refraining from eating in the 2-3 hours before bedtime, and sleeping on a gentle incline of 3-6 inches of elevation of the head of the bed frame, using bed-risers. Turning to allergic symptoms, post-nasal drainage and mouth-breathing due to congestion can combine to irritate the vocal cords and the membranes around the vocal cords, in a way that can add to the irritative effect of acid reflux, whereby acid can contact these areas, particularly during the night's sleep. Antihistamines are good at targeting the 3 cardinal symptoms of allergy: sneeze, itch and runny nose. However, they will neither decongest nor control allergic inflammation, the latter being the fundamental issue in allergic disease and the cause of post-nasal drip. A good topical nasal spray approach can be highly effective in calming nasal inflammation and in doing so, diminishing or eliminating the symptoms it causes, namely congestion, post-nasal drip runny nose, sneeze and itch. Specifically with respect to the use of Flonase, we disfavor the use of fluticasone propionate since this medication requires an alcohol solvent, which could irritate the entire airway including the throat in several ways. At Allermi, we combine multiple nasal spray medications into one, alcohol-free formula to comprehensively address all of these symptoms with one nasal spray. From the immunotherapeutic standpoint, my group and I have not favored sublingual immunotherapy for a number of reasons, including reduced effectiveness in comparison with traditional subcutaneous immunotherapy, i.e., allergy shots. The potential for irritative and allergic side-effects, and perhaps an increased risk of esophageal inflammation in the form of eosinophilic esophagitis, which could be contributing to your acid reflux. I hope this information is helpful. ]"
I'm 17 . I have been suffering from skin allergies since I was 12 years old. But something new is happening these days. My eyes swell up and down again for no reason. I have been in severe pain for days. And it lasts for days. Is it related to allergies?,"[16&&stanfordallergist&& Hello, I am sorry to hear you're experiencing this. Your history of allergy does make you more likely to develop new allergic reactions in the future, so it is possible that your eye swelling is related to allergy. I would recommend you contact your primary care doctor or allergist, or visit urgent care as soon as you can. In the meantime, what I would recommend to my own patient that would be generally safe would be to try a non-sedating oral anti-histamine. For this, we would recommend generic, non-prescription Allegra (fexofenadine), 180-mg, twice-daily. I would also recommend Pataday Extra-Strength (olopatadine) 0.7% antihistamine eye drop, one drop per eye once daily. And, lastly, ice-pack treatment of your eyes using ice covered by a thin towel for 5-10 minutes at a time, several times a day. I hope this is helpful. ]"

My brother was a piano player on a cruise ship. He got kicked off for getting super drunk.

There was a woman in the string quartet who allegedly slept with a guest and she just disappeared one day. We have a LOT of people go home for breathing over the limit on random alcohol tests. I’ve heard a few stories about people who missed the all aboard time and the ship sailed without them. That’s an automatic bye bye too ]

Can you not drink at all during the whole trip?,"[91&&droo46&& Not OP, but the sax player I knew who did extensive work on cruise ships said that the crew typically has their own bar away from the guests. As long as you aren’t drunk for performances you’re fine. ]"
Can you not drink at all during the whole trip?,"[25&&Serwyn_&& So because part of the production cast’s job is to socialize, we actually get a stipend of $150 each month to get drinks in guest areas in case the want to spend time with us in a bar area etc. So it’s a little bit a part of our job. But despite that, we can be fired if we are tested and over .05 while off duty or .04 while on duty. Basically there’s a culture of, “we know everyone goes over that limit but unless you’re clearly drunk while on duty, or doing something rowdy, we won’t test you”. What gets people is the random alcohol tests every month at 10 am where people are still drunk from the night before. Honestly drinking is a huge part of ship life because of how cheap alcohol is in crew bar. It’s like $1.50 per drink ]"
Can you not drink at all during the whole trip?,"[19&&Cmn1723&& Not OP but I have worked on several cruise lines between 2017 and 2020. You can drink as a crew member but you’re technically not allowed to get drunk. Some positions, like officers or security, are never allowed to drink for safety reasons. However, pretty much everyone drinks and gets drunk on ships because it was about $1-3 per glass or shot for crew. ]"

"Second Life has been pushing a lot of updates recently, do you think they have the chance to bring it back and win the race to running the Metaverse, especially when competeing with companies like Epic?","[2&&slhamlet&& I hope so, especially now that there's a mobile app (finally) coming soon! But would definitely take some drastic changes and a huge marketing/branding campaign to relaunch SL as a brand to a new generation that barely remembers Second Life. Linden Lab would have to raise a lot of money to do that. But if the mobile version gains traction and grows the user base, Linden could build off that. IMVU is a much more limited competitor, but once it went to mobile, it grew like crazy, gaining over 7 million users. ]"
"Hey Hamlet! I've been in SL 19 years, and there's been a nearly continuously stream of 'THIS WILL BE THE END OF SL!' legal/social dramas, policy changes, new features and more. Of the many to choose from, which had you most worried about the fate of SL, and which do you think was the most absurd/funny?","[4&&slhamlet&& Haha yeah! I think the first ""SL is dying!"" prediction was in 2004 when Linden Lab started selling private islands. I guess the funniest version is during the 2005-2007 hype wave's height, when the website Valleywag kept predicting Second Life was dying, and it kept not dying. The editor got so annoyed about it he emailed me saying it must be a cult or something! The most worrying thing was Second Life's failure to grow past its 600-700K hardcore userbase. That one even freaked out Linden Lab. It's why my chapter on SL is the longest one in the book -- trying to solve the mystery of how something that got so much publicity just stubbornly refused to grow. Fortunately Second Life also stubbornly refuses to die. ]"

Way less of a reputational challenge when a thing has tens of millions of users vs. around half a million. ]"
Hey James! 20 years… amazing. Congrats. Did you expect to be writing about Second Life and the Metaverse for 20 years?,"[3&&slhamlet&& Thanks! Wow, it's been a weird ride for sure. The first few years I thought Second Life was a very interesting niche MMO. Then when the hype wave started up and it got attention from like, everywhere -- like top US judge Richard Posner giving a talk in Second Life -- I started thinking it really could become the Metaverse. But then there was a lull between about 2010-2018, as people shifted to social media and mobile, and I started thinking it was going to remain a niche. But then other platforms like Fortnite, Roblox, and VRChat started picking up steam and then a 2nd hype wave started, but this time with a huge user base around it. So it's been super cool to see renewed interest in the idea, and see that this time, it's going to last! ]"
"Two sort of related questions... I think screen addiction is no joke, based on my 9 year old son and my own behavior. My son really suffers with boredom when he's forced to get off the screen. Is there any concern that people will just be barely able to function in the ""real world"" at some point? The related question is whether the human body - especially eyes and circulation - has an infinite capacity to stay plugged in and not wear out before old age. I know people will just say ""just moderate yourself"" but I really think that reality will continue to seem less and less appealing.","[2&&slhamlet&& Good questions and those are definitely valid concerns! Beyond the ""just moderate yourself"" answer, I think the key issue is that social media are designed for engagement and emotional outrage, putting us in these loops where we keep obsessively checking for likes and/or liking/dunking on other people's posts. By definition a metaverse platform is about engaging with other people from around the world in real time, and I'm hopeful that breaks us out of the social media feedback loop and connects us more genuinely with others. Also for kids, I definitely think metaverse companies should actively discourage or even prohibit minors from excess usage, even rewarding them for moderating their usage. I talk with experts like Anya Kamenetz about this topic. At some point regulators will probably need to step in! ]"

They are much more like going to a cafe and talking to people. They are also very useful for people who can't get to real world cafes to meet people for different reasons. ]

The basic concept of ""moving an avatar around in a 3D online space"" is finally pretty mainstream. It would probably be different now, but the name/branding ""Second Life"" in 2003 just invited so many negative connotations and backlash. I asked Hunter Walk about that, since he kinda came up with the name during his Linden Lab days (he's a famous VC now), and he kinda agreed. Philip too, to a certain extent.

SL does a lot of Adsense-type marketing and even invested in a big budget video spot a few years ago, but nothing has moved the needle in terms of growing the user base. Hopefully they do a big marketing push around the mobile launch, that's their best (last?) hope to grow the user base! ]"

I suppose that's reflective of their personality as a whole though.,"[7&&anon1029436292&& Just a heads up, generally ‘rude’ junior doctors are not rude because of you, they are just really overwhelmed and juggling too many things at once. If it is targeted rudeness fuck them, but that’s generally not the case I hope. Both times I’ve had someone say to me ‘well that was rude’ or ‘could have a bit more polite’ I had either cried within the last 20 minutes or was about to cry, and realistically if I was in any other job would not be attempting to keep working. I quite often ignore cleaners etc, but it’s genuinely because I’m trying to remember 5 things at the same time, whilst also listening to my boss (who might shout at me if I miss something) and a nurse who’s trying to ask me a question, and the stupid bleep going off. We also move jobs every 4 months at my stage, so names end up meaning nothing because you trying to learn 100 new names every few months, plus all your patients. Sorry if this comes off as rude, outside of work when we’ve had sleep I swear we are normal people. We are all just very very burnt out. And generally from a junior POV we don’t look down on you, although I am certainly jealous of your pay on weekends and bank holidays. ]"

I suppose that's reflective of their personality as a whole though.,"[2&&GenoAir&& Absolutely this, not sure if this is my personality or being there a while, but the rude doctors / head nurses I’ll stand up too just as much as anyone else. I worked a lot on theatres and I’d say 80% of the surgeons will know me by first name, ask me about what’s going on in life and I’ll do the same and sit and chat for a while with me which always feels great. I think over the years it’s just been building relationships with people. There will always be the entitled higher positions, but then you’ll see entitled NA’s that think they are better than us, definitely down to their personality though. I’ve made a lot of friends with the people on stores and the operational side of things, we love a good chat on the corridors usually asking what time we’re finishing hahaha. Appreciate you mate, thanks for the comment also! ]"
"As a person who started that kind of job, what kept you motivated to not give up or how did you overcome any fear/difficult situations at your work?","[11&&GenoAir&& I think because both my older brothers worked here, plus my mum. Also the support network here is amazing. I’ve been on bank which is 0 hours, so they’ve allowed me to go off to university and come back on term breaks etc. but I’ll gladly work 60+ hours a week there because although it’s hard work, there’s so many people around you to support you. One of my favourite parts of the Job is being able to talk to the patients, they have so many incredible stories and their faces light up when they talk about them. I’ve found so many interesting things out about them and it’s like a bond. It makes you realise that with me progressing into adult life, that people can be going through the worst things in their lifetimes and still crack a laugh with you. I had to mature relatively young with the things I had to witness, but being able to count on the people around you in those moments is second to none ]"
"From your experience, is the NHS as stretched as the MSM depicts it to be? They all say it’s on its knees, where you are, how are things?","[10&&GenoAir&& Sorry for the long reply, just finished my shift now. I’d say it is, we still have our slow days but it gets bad when you noticed 1 or 2 NA’s (nursing assistants) on a ward with 4 bays (usually around 6 patients per bay) and 4 side rooms (1 patient per room). I remember a few years ago you’d have 4-5 per ward but it’s common to see much less. Even with housekeeping, I’ll be doing the job of 2-3 people on my own, it does affect us a lot and I see a lot of people leaving now which makes the problems harder. But then at the same time through adversity we make lemonade, I Can’t speak for other trusts but we always go the extra mile to still give the same amount to patients and patient families. But yes, we’re crying out and hopefully things will improve soon ]"
"Do you find cleaning for others affects your ability to clean your own space? I'm terrible about upkeep for myself, but I seem to have no problems cleaning for others. I wonder if you have the same thing, or maybe even the opposite.","[1&&GenoAir&& Haha this one made me laugh, it absolutely does, growing up my parents would say about my room being untidy and I’ll have the excuse of ‘I’ve been cleaning for 12 hours today, I can’t clean for another hour!’ Or I’ll say I get paid to clean at work, I don’t get paid here haha But this does just come with pushing yourself to look after yourself and the area around you. It does slack sometimes but I eventually get around to do it ]"

What's your favourite memory from work? Thanks for doing what you do.,"[2&&GenoAir&& There’s a lot to choose from! From staff to staff, I used to love the noro virus deepcleans pre covid. There would be about 15-20 housekeepers, music going on a closed ward just cleaning and having a good time with it. Most of us were quite young as-well so we made it fun. Patient wise, there are so many to count. The general ones I’d say are when I’d sit and talk to dementia patients, they’d be delirious for days and then all of a sudden tell you about how they were in the marching band in the army, they’d be so happy talking about it. There was a patient that came in for a knee op, which then led to an infection and then her being in a coma on ITU, and then consequently she was an inpatient on a ward for 7 months with health complications. Every day I would go on there and it was like seeing a friend, we all celebrated when she was finally discharged like a little party. But even getting to know her, she was in her 30s, life completely changed but would still be crying with laughter with us and the nurses. There has been some amazing memories here, it’s hard work and I’ve cried a bunch and bled and all sorts, but the amazing people you meet every day make it worth it, I’ve just graduated from university and looking to start my career. But I always have here no matter what ]"
How often do you encounter thrash? How did your family react to your choice of profession?,"[1&&GenoAir&& So I have 2 older brothers, they both were housekeepers before me (they have both left now) , and my mum works in the X-ray department, so we have all been working here for a long while and you notice that most people that work here, also have family here too. Regards to thrash and stick, you’ll mostly get it from the higher ups in management that never have worked the job in their life, so we don’t take it personally. And then patient families will also be quite aggrevated in some situations, but for them I don’t take it personally and just apologise and try to cater to them. They’re going through an extremely stressful point in their life so their stress levels will be high. You have to have a thick skin and not take things to heart I guess. My friends my age will be shocked at the stories I tell of what I’ve seen and experienced, but as sad as it is I’ve almost become desensitised to most things, but can still get emotional at the end of a shift some times. Just have to be strong and help everyone around you I gues ]"

This is a very interesting topic for me, and so I have a few questions for you: How would you rate HealthyGamerGG's youtube channel in terms of his information and tips? To me it seems like a good channel with the host having a past situation similar to yours but it's always hard to judge the quality of a medical/mental health communicator. What would you say to a young child to get him on a balanced life with technology before any addiction happens? It seems like it's very difficult in today's world for a young influenceable mind to not stick to their phone like everyone else is doing. In the same vein, what would you say to someone who is deeply addicted and not concerned about its effect on their life? Have you seen a link between social isolation and time past on technology (watching videos, playing video games or simply doom scrolling on phone)? Also, how can someone gain back their lost social life when they spent their development years not socializing? Thank you and sorry for all the questions! ]"

What is considered a video game addiction? What conditions have to be met to distinguish between a regular person who plays them in their free time vs. an addict?,"[204&&adamholmanlcsw&& Often times when I get asked this question, people are hoping for a specific amount of hours. Especially in the age of Esports and games that take 100's of hours to complete, the amount of time that someone can play and still be healthy really varies. Instead of looking at hours, it is best to look at how it impacts the person. There are two metrics that I use: -Your video game use is starting to cause other issues. For instance, my playing was causing me to fail school, socially isolate, and even caused me a repetitive stress injury in my wrist that still impacts me to this day. -You're functioning well in your life, but you're playing video games despite them not being very fun anymore and wanting to do other things. Outside of the basic things needed to function, gaming is the only priority. ]"

Drugs feel good too and they also stop you from doing other things. Video games, drugs, porn, food, it's all a means to create dopamine. Lots of things give you dopamine but if you need dopamine that bad that you can't be bothered to do some exercise to get that dopamine instead of the easily accessible video game dopamine, then it sounds like on some level you need it. If it goes from want to need then you may have a problem. You may be using it in that manner because something else is happening. Anxiety, depression, stress, discomfort, whatever the case may be. It's really bad, as OP said, if you aren't even getting joy out of the game. Then you're using it out of a habit and out of a time sink.

It won't necessarily work for everyone's space, but I actually do most of my gaming from an exercise bike. That's obviously easier when playing games with a controller, but I also have a tray table that will extend over my bike to give me a surface for a keyboard and mouse. How much I pedal while playing will vary from game to game, but the option is there. For enough games, my legs are just going the whole time on autopilot. Alternately, there are games out there which are exercise themselves (Dance Dance Revolution or Beat Saber, for instance), but those also require extra hardware. But there are also mobile games that can be a good excuse for exercise. Pokemon Go was able to get me walking/running outside more than before. I haven't really used it myself, but Zombies Run sounds pretty popular and will gamify running sessions. And if none of the above work, if you can manage it, you can try video games as the reward for working out. On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, no video games until you've done a half hour of exercise. If that's a bit much, maybe just start with one day a week and work your way up from there. ]"

"If someone is recovering from a gaming addiction, do you normally recommend them staying away like with alcohol or other drug addiction or is it healthy to just moderate because it's not physically additive like those are?","[43&&adamholmanlcsw&& This really varies from person to person, however with most people, I end up suggesting an approach that eventually involves moderation. It can be really helpful to have some time away from gaming completely. If the person is willing, we'll create a plan that involves spending a few weeks away from games completely, then returning to games in a way that allows them balance (as defined by them). This helps break up some of the habits and patterns that existed before, and many people find themselves appreciating video games more after returning. That within itself makes it worth it for many.

I think it's wise to try to push for that, while also pushing for gamers and consumers to have a better understanding of what's going on so that they can make informed choices and vote with their dollars/time. ]"
"But do you just think this way because you have a ""sunk cost"", in the same way a person who has been persuaded to buy a $1000 phone will then try and convince their friends to do the same? As a videogame enthusiast, what are the negative sides, how do videogames impact a person's attention span, their ability to interact in a non-mediated way with other people, their motivation, their ability to think outside the box?","[20&&adamholmanlcsw&& Had you spoken to me 5-years ago, I would not have believed that video games had a significant impact on attention span, motivation, and thinking. Having experienced how differently my brain works on the other side, then seeing the same thing in my clients, I'm now certain that all of these are impacted by excessive video game use. It's important to know that when used in balance, video games can actually positively impact the mind in a lot of ways, and excess is really what makes the poison. When I was in the depths of it and playing upwards of 16-hours per day, everyday tasks were PAINFULLY boring. To my partner's dismay, a simple task like going to the grocery store seemed like the biggest chore. In addition, I had a hard time reading anything longer than a paragraph, and anything that didn't have step-by-step instructions was hard for me to get started on.Part of my process of finding balance involved spending a few weeks away from gaming. Life circumstances at the time made that an easy and obvious choice. It was striking to me that when I returned, I could go to the grocery store and actually enjoy it. Things like focus and operationalizing the challenges in my life took more deliberate effort, but also improved. ]"
Are there any published studies about the effects of exposure to videogames/internet media with young adults and teens? Were your parents right and was your relationship with video games unhealthy?,"[81&&adamholmanlcsw&& My parents were most definitely correct, but the more they tried to convince me, the worse it got. Underneath my video game use was a lot of shame. Not only did I not feel that shame when I played games, I felt proud because I was pretty good at them. The more they pushed on me, the more shame I felt, and the more I wanted to play. Research is growing. South Korea has been doing great research for a long time, and HealthyGamer is doing some excellent work right now. One important thing to point out is that with balanced use, video games actually can be BENEFICIAL! It's the lack of balance that causes challenges. Here is a really solid Meta-Analysis that was pre-pandemic. My anecdotal experience is that a lot of this has increased post-pandemic, however science moves slowly: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33028074/ ]"

My parents had tried to convince me to get everything done before I play games, and I was especially resistant to that idea because I felt like it reinforced the idea that I had a problem.

My thought was, ""I don't know if this will matter, but I want to see what it feels like to play video games without having worry in the back of my head."" I promised myself that for a week, I could play as many video games as I wanted after I had taken care of all of my responsibilities for the day.

"Hi! This is a very interesting topic for me, and so I have a few questions for you: How would you rate HealthyGamerGG's youtube channel in terms of his information and tips? To me it seems like a good channel with the host having a past situation similar to yours but it's always hard to judge the quality of a medical/mental health communicator. What would you say to a young child to get him on a balanced life with technology before any addiction happens? It seems like it's very difficult in today's world for a young influenceable mind to not stick to their phone like everyone else is doing. In the same vein, what would you say to someone who is deeply addicted and not concerned about its effect on their life? Have you seen a link between social isolation and time past on technology (watching videos, playing video games or simply doom scrolling on phone)? Also, how can someone gain back their lost social life when they spent their development years not socializing? Thank you and sorry for all the questions!","[32&&adamholmanlcsw&& Dr. K and HealthyGamer are great. His information is extremely solid, and he truly understands mental health, finding balance in technology use, and mental wellbeing. Also you're right; we have remarkably similar histories. I have a feeling many other people share our story, and that this is simply the nature of growing up in the era of competitive gaming. I would start by talking about how awesome technology and games are and understanding why they want to use it so much. Why? Because it's true! I would then tell them that I want them to keep enjoying it, and that I want them to be healthy, too. I would empathize with the fact that their friends maybe don't have the same limits, and would set limits nonetheless. As much as possible, I would recruit them to help determine what is healthy and what those limits should be. I would say that this person has become hopeless, and understand what has caused them to feel so hopeless. I wouldn't try to convince them that they should stop playing games, or that they need to stop playing games. In fact, I would probably say, ""If life has become this miserable, it makes sense to me that gaming is how you want to spend your time. Can you help me understand what has been making life so miserable?"" Most certainly. One thing to note is that video games are also a great social activity in balance. During the pandemic, gamers THRIVED. At the same time, while socializing through video games is legitimate, it isn't a replacement to face-to-face communication. Without face-to-face communication, social skills atrophy. There is good news though: 1. Social skills return with practice 2. Social skills are, in fact, a skill. Thus, they can be learned. There is no way around this; it will take confronting the anxiety of socializing, and then needing to practice. I recommend choosing some kind of IRL activity that is engaging, enjoyable, or useful to you. This way you have a task to focus on while socializing which can take some of the pressure off.

I have a lot of empathy for parents who are trying to set boundaries in the technology age, because there just isn't a simple answer. Two rules of thumb when it comes to boundaries: -If it is causing a problem for your child whether that be socially, physically, mentally, or academically, it needs to be addressed.-Boundaries should be set from a place of understanding, compassion, and discipline, not from a place of punishment. In addition, boundaries should be set beforehand.

My friend, who almost never went to this particular supermarket, asked what we were looking for. We said ""oh, [drink]"", and she glanced along the aisle, pointed at the drink and said ""there it is"". We'd also frequent our local arcade, and they had a ""Deal or No Deal"" game where you could win tickets. She'd walk up to the screen, stare at it while the briefcases were switching around at high speed, then point at one and say ""this one"", and she'd be right every single time. Must be frustrating as fuck to have that level of visual impairment, but what she could see, she could see like an owl sees a mouse in the dead of night. ]"
"I wish everyone knew about the visual impairment aspect. They can deduce the easy sunburning but likely assume I have perfect vision. The amount of ""it's over there,"" or ""it's in aisle seven,"" or cashiers just waving without saying anything.",[1&&MBTHVSK&& I have a parent with albinism. I knew that their vision problem was associated with albinism. I asked if their intolerance for spicy food might be related and was told it was dumb to assume that. Sorry to all of you who eat hot sauce. ]

The amount of ""it's over there,"" or ""it's in aisle seven,"" or cashiers just waving without saying anything.",[1&&rotorylampshade&& What is your night vision like? ]
My partner has albinism and the vision impairment was something that took a while to understand the extent of even after dating for a good while. I've learned to anticipate where it's a problem and help where possible but even 20 years later it's sometimes difficult to understand the combo of lighting & nystagmus as someone with bad but correctable vision. I wish there were corrective options that helped more.,"[74&&AlbinoAlex&& It definitely takes some getting used to, and it’s hard because even small things like opening a window shade for more light or moving the mailbox keys can be easy for you but problematic for your partner. It’s also stuff you don’t think about like if you go to a party with a buffet setup: Where are the plates? Forks? Where’s the bin? You can walk into a room and identify all those things easily but I can’t! But I’m sure your partner would say you’re doing a great job :) ]"
Is getting glasses or contacts different with albinism?,"[53&&AlbinoAlex&& It’s the same in that we go to the eye doctor and get a prescription and such but different in that they probably won’t help. Glasses and contacts fix nearsightedness and farsightedness which are issues with the cornea in the front of your eye (which is also how LASIK works, it just reshapes the cornea). In albinism the issues are in the back of the eye, so changing the way light hits the retina won’t change a broken retina. Glasses and contacts do help to some degree, like for me they make the world a bit sharper, but they won’t get us to 20/20 vision or anywhere close to it. ]"
So it's vision impairment that can't be helped with corrective lenses? Or it only helps to a degree? (I was legally blind without lenses before I had LASIK so I know a little bit about how it can suck when you can't see details.),"[24&&AlbinoAlex&& Only to a degree depending on the person. Like with glasses I go from 20/400 to 20/200 which is basically going from shitty vision to slightly less shitty vision, though still in the threshold of legally blind. The vision issues in albinism are in the back of the eye, so things like glasses and LASIK don’t help since they only fix the front of the eye. ]"

The next best thing would be AR glasses that could parse out key details or give super vision. ]"

For example, an autistic person might focus on details and miss the bigger picture. A common example for a school-age person would be to form letters perfectly, but forget that the purpose of the task is to complete a short answer or essay. Within a certain time frame. For an adult that could need to get a recipe or other task done just so and lose track of the time frame to completion. With ADHD, the attention to detail becomes a distractor and derails the person from the task at hand. There can be a hyper fixation about details and things being just so in both diagnoses. With OCD, however it can be different. The attention to detail is a source of stress and anxiety and the compulsions are ways to control and reduce that anxiety.

I was also diagnosed ADHD in my 30's and put on Vyvanse. The initial 30mg dosage basically did nothing as far as I could tell. It was so ineffectual that my doc broke protocol and titrated me directly to 50mg to see if a larger dose would have effect. Oh boy it did. It was like the alertness you'd get from drinking two or three coffees, except without the jitters and for 10+ hours straight. Both sleeping and eating became optional activities. Long story short, we titrated down to 40mg and then back to 30mg to lessen the side effects. Only now do I realize that 30mg was working, just in subtle ways and without major side effects. The primary effect, the thing you want from the drug, is that my actions became purposeful and intentional. I stopped doing things without thinking. I was more effective.

"Not the OP, but I got my ADD diagnosis late last year after asking for a second opinion and was pretty lucky with my first medication showing good results (methylphenidate, but bear in mind what works for someone is a very individual thing - biology is weird). I'd probably not describe it much like as if a flip has been switched, but rather that I'm having an easier time staying focused on tasks when I need to, am generally less tired during the day and find it easier to summon the energy to do boring tasks. It hasn't solved my life's problems, as I still struggle with them, but it is easier and noticeably so. I think the right expectation to have when you find something that works for you is things being just a bit easier in the day-to-day. It may not sound like a lot, but it does make a comparative world of difference!","[15&&MourkaCat&& Thank you for your perspective!!

Yeah, tasks are real hard, even ones I enjoy. Like, I know I should do them, and I would love to do them, but it just doesn't feel right? Like, I'll get started with a game I really like and 5 minutes in it's like borderline physically painful to keep playing it. It goes both ways and is for sure one of the biggest tells that it wasn't just laziness, but proper executive dysfunction and being a highly vibes-based being as a result of ADD. Also, too high doses can for sure feel bad. Too low doesn't do much, if anything at all, and too high can be very uncomfortable and very zoom-y. If you do manage to get ahold of a professional in that specific field, they'll for sure help you find something that works. It may take some time though, as not all meds work for everyone, and sometimes it takes going through all of them to find the one that works dead last on the list. Have some friends who reported this, at least. Patience is unfortunately key here :/ I'm glad my words are helpful, though :) Wish you the best of luck with figuring it out - but it is very much a bit of a journey. Especially if you do get the right meds and realise you may not ""feel"" like you're doing better, but paying attention to the small things you suddenly feel capable of doing, just sometimes, quickly adds up <3 ]"

Motivation is LOW) and was hoping medication would help me get my butt into gear at least a little bit easier? This is precisely the effect medication should be having. It's not a magic bullet, and doesn't automatically solve your problems. But it does make it so much easier to ""get your butt in gear"" and tackle the thing ADHD you would totally procrastinate on. Have you ever had ""on"" days, where you are in the flow, you've got tons of creative energy, and you're in that positive feedback zone where making tons of progress on something makes you feel good and gives you the boost you need to go on to the next thing? Surely at some point in your life you've experienced this. Pre-diagnosis I was only able to get into the zone 1 or 2 times a month, if that. On medication, with the right dosage, it is literally an everyday occurrence. Try different dosages. And if that doesn't work, try different meds. Hope you can find a new doctor. I keep thinking maybe I wasn't paying attention properly and to give the meds another go, but the higher dosage make me feel like I was made out of bees.... I did not feel nice at all so I'm not keen to take more. One significant side effect of all stimulants is that they can turn you into an asshole if you're not careful. It's so easy to get frustrated with ""all the stupid people around you"", even though off-medication I'd be much more empathetic and never think of others that way. For me at least it is simple enough to correct for if you are conscious and aware of it, and the meds make it easy for even an ADHD person to be more conscious and aware of things. Unfortunately there is a gender component here. Stims can make you more aggressive and less empathetic, which in a man is a masculine and desirable trait. The same personality change in a woman might be described as being a raging bitch :( It makes you a better girl boss though. ]"

"I'm male, and not a doctor like OP. But maybe my experience is useful. I was also diagnosed ADHD in my 30's and put on Vyvanse. The initial 30mg dosage basically did nothing as far as I could tell. It was so ineffectual that my doc broke protocol and titrated me directly to 50mg to see if a larger dose would have effect. Oh boy it did. It was like the alertness you'd get from drinking two or three coffees, except without the jitters and for 10+ hours straight. Both sleeping and eating became optional activities. Long story short, we titrated down to 40mg and then back to 30mg to lessen the side effects. Only now do I realize that 30mg was working, just in subtle ways and without major side effects. The primary effect, the thing you want from the drug, is that my actions became purposeful and intentional. I stopped doing things without thinking. I was more effective. I had greater energy reserves and was less likely to procrastinate. I could think more clearly, and was less likely to be distracted. But these effects are very subtle.

I had a few 30mg laying around still and tried that out and while I didn't get buzzy I didn't notice anything helpful. Not clearer thinking, not an easier way to initiate tasks... I was just plain old struggling me still, it seemed. It's 100% something I'm thinking of and still wonder ""Maybe I should try again"" but that buzzy feeling is so off putting I'd rather not suffer a full day of that again.

And the answer is that autism isn't spiking, autism diagnoses are. Awareness and understanding of things like ADHD and autism are very very new phenomena, so naturally there are more diagnoses happening now than there were.

We are not as rushed to have kids and not as able to feel secure to have kids until we are older and can afford homes and become debt free. I'm an older parent and have found the research and total lack of research, for two older parents, to be intriguing and frustrating (not on autism specifically, but on all sorts of affects that maternal and paternal age and social economic and other factors can have on children) . I think as more people become parents later in life, we will start finding more trends and more answers, but for now, the data on a lot of these questions just requires more time, analysis, and more data being collected in the first place.

It is so important to know about, and I hope it helps someone reading this AMA. Thanks so much for your work and efforts to educate the public. For anyone else, here's why the content of this AMA is extremely important to getting proper treatment: I was diagnosed with autism at 21 by a psychiatrist who specialized in women on the spectrum. Due to a genetic neuro condition attempted suicide for the first time about 3 years ago. The psych ward and 6 different psychiatrists I met with afterwards kept insisting on bipolar or bpd instead of my autism diagnosis, despite having a full record of the extensive diagnostics and report from my prior psych. The psych ward, despite being part of a hospital, refused my requests for a neurologist and instead forced me to go on medications for bpd. It had horrific side effects, causing psychosis. This all nearly prevented me from being able to get proper care for the then undiagnosed neuro condition. It was finally a nurse practitioner at a psych practice who had adult sons with both ADHD and Autism who recognized in our first appointment that something was wrong, and referred me immediately to a neurologist. I also ended up getting a full assessment for my cognitive abilities and ADHD - they found that I had undiagnosed ADHD at 27, and that I had brain damage and now permanent cognitive impairment that affects my short term memory and auditory processing. I've been much better after starting dopamine treatment and other neuro medications. I don't think I would be here today if that NP hadn't had the knowledge that other practices I saw clearly did not have on the misdiagnosis potential of BPD/bipolar, and I wouldn't have gotten on the medications I actually needed. ]"

My New Agey comment comes from it sounding vaguely religious but hidden under assumptions of just admiring or ""being one"" with nature and fully respecting the wonder of it. In any case, it's also a way of me saying it all sounds a bit ""hippyish"" for lack of a better word? A bit out there. And I'm sure if I read more into what you're actually saying that's not true at all. It might be a generational thing, whereas the younger generations tend to associate themselves less and less with anything to do with religion these days, especially because most we see or read about it is about restriction our rights, freedoms, etc. I think the entire notion of calling it religious naturalism immediately carries negative associations with it for a lot of people, which is why I would much prefer a less loaded term that doesn't have millenia of history behind it and doesn't assume you can only truly appreciate the wonder of life if there's some sort of religious sentiment behind it; ""A divine miracle of creation"" instead of just ""Wow, isn't nature amazing!""

There’s something to be said for all that security.","[17&&cucumbercat57&& I feel like this take lives in a vacuum. Crypto is a complex technology that requires a relatively high level of computer proficiency to use directly. Because of this, basically since its inception, third parties have inserted themselves to make things easier for the end user. At this point, basically 100% of people who deal with crypto do so through a third party, often a VC-funded startup with much less regulatory oversight than the established monolithic financial industry. As well, even the nature of crypto itself — every transaction being a permanent addition to a ledger — I'd argue is less secure than traditional assets. You can be sure that your funds are in the hands of the receiving address, but that's not inherently secure. In fact, it means fraud, hacks, and simple mistakes are set in stone and can only be undone through access to the receiving wallet, if it even exists. This is not even to mention that, because crypto's value is entirely beholden to speculation, it is simply too volatile to be used as a currency in everyday life, and even at its most stable is still vulnerable to mismanagement by those same third parties that allow the general populace to participate. The financial system we have is certainly not perfect, there's no doubt about that. But the crypto space has essentially just recreated the traditional financial system we already have, just with extra steps and fewer protections for the end users. All this, supported by a small country's worth of power fueling purposely wasteful brute forcing of random math problems in order to ensure that the money it made up isn't spent twice. Is it worth it to be using the most powerful single computer network to prop this up? I'd say no, it very much isn't. ]"

It's not guaranteed that anyone will ever get a recovery of assets that they've had stolen or that they've had hacked or given away to scammers. There are, however, opportunities to track and trace assets to places where they can be recovered with the help of law enforcement.I mean if the crypto scammers got the money in China/India/North Korea, even with the exact address of the scammers, your local police department can't really do anything about it.Just because local police doesn't have the ability to go overseas doesn't mean they can't help. many times local law enforcement helps put together enough information that makes it easier for federal law enforcement to pick up the case. many of these foreign actors are part of organized crime and there are many many victims involved. eventually these types of situations are going to lead to a criminal Enterprise which is being investigated by federal agencies. so a recovery may not occur right away but should a bust happen several years down the road and your case is part of the bigger investigation you should receive restitutionAnd in most places they don't even bother, unless they got some new guy who's hopes and dreams were not crushed yet and wants to impress the boss. But either way, no way to get your money back.I understand your frustration and it sounds like you've worked with local law enforcement in the past. yes it does seem to be that the Old Guard is less likely to help than a fresh new recruit however we're seeing more and more local law enforcement learning about how to proceed with these cases. In fact I had a officer from Quakertown Pennsylvania subpoena Binance and receive a successful response.Or is there?so to clarify there are two ways to get your money back one is initially through asset seizure at an exchange or a subpinoble entity or somewhere down the road, could be 2 years or more, you could receive restitution from the bust of a big investigation ]"

When the internet became more commonplace in households, the initial reaction from academia was to ban its use, requiring sources cited from hard copy periodicals, books, and other reference material. But some schools and individual teachers leaned into the new technology, teaching students how to use it to their benefit. This required a firmer grasp on evaluating the quality and bias of sources, and it taught lifelong lessons associated with such practices. I would argue this is no different. Teachers should embrace new technologies, especially ones that are likely to become valued in the job market. This is off the top of my head, but if I taught literature, for example, I would introduce my students to Chat GPT and have them come up with three questions that yield valuable information on the theme, cultural context, and impact of a novel or poem we are reading. Then they evaluate the AI response they feel they could use it in a professional capacity. They would have to turn in the questions they came up with, the AI responses, and their evaluation. Based on recent trends, it seems AI is here to stay. Teachers can spend their time policing students to ensure they follow trends of the past, or they can prepare them for an evolving job market that will value experience using artificial intelligence.

I've been thinking about this for some time - it may be a pipe dream but the corporate world is slowly destroying my soul. We've talked about it at home and I have the support to take the plunge if I decide to. A few questions: Is it viable to run a brick & mortar without focusing on used inventory? I feel like I don't know enough to get a sense of what is and isn't a good used purchase. Forgive such a basic question...but does new stock come directly from labels or are you primarily dealing with a distributor? Is it multiple distributors or do these businesses largely cover 90% of the releases? Do you do much for online sales outside of a Discogs store? Do you have any recommendations on inventory management / POS systems? What kind of margins are you typically making on new inventory? I have to imagine your discount rates probably aren't justifying a lot of movement when you're up against Target / Urban Outfitter / Best Buy spends from the same distributors? I have a million more questions but I'll pause it there. I expect I'd be taking a significant pay cut...but again the constant pressure of managing a corporate business focused purely on NR growth and EBITA stability is absolutely exhausting. ]

Flipping through the last month or so I didn’t see where we had sold it (and I think I would have remembered). Told them we’d only do an exchange, which they weren’t happy about but did. On reflection the next day, I realized they were a shoplifter. Told everyone to be on the lookout, but I suspect they took their exchange somewhere else and tried to do a receipt-less return there. Question: Have you noticed an increase in shrink, now that the media is popularizing gang-sized theft?",[3&&NeatX3Records&& We have extremely low shrink. I have more shrink from damage (by far) than theft. Every so often I see a CD that got pulled from its case (like… come on. Steal the whole thing) The vast majority of folks are honest and they want to see you succeed. ]
"What's the coolest LP jacket design you've ever seen?

I love the art for The Slider. Also most of the Coheed and Cambria catalog (especially Vaxis II). Most of the Einsturzende Neubauten catalog as well. I love all the old Blue Note covers, where they all shared a stylistic thumbprint.

It looks like there was a 1970s pressing of that, but I bet it didn’t get out there much, as the buying public would have moved on by then.

What's the average profit margin for records sold in your shop?,"[1&&NeatX3Records&& Again, that varies wildly. For new LPs, it would be hard to expect anything over a 30% profit margin. RSD titles are significantly slimmer than that, and are primarily categorized (in my head, anyway) as “door buster” titles. They are the titles that get people in the door, and hopefully they buy other stuff that is actually profitable. Dollar stock or budget bin records are generally ALL profit, meaning they are the records that you take along with the other stuff that you actually WANT to buy. When I calculate in my head an offer, I generally calculate very little (if anything at all) for stuff that I know is going to immediately hit my dollar bin. I also don’t really expect that stuff to sell, but if it does, great. For better used stuff, the margin varies quite a bit. If it’s something I know I have a customer for right away (meaning later that afternoon) I might give a little more for it, just so I can call that client and make their day. Otherwise, I’m shooting for 30-50% of what the I store retail price will be. Keep in mind, there are far more costs to a used LP than simply buying it. Processing takes labor ($$$) Marketing takes $$$ The space in the rack needs to be filled with compelling titles that people are excited to see, which requires curation. My landlord likes to get paid every month. If he doesn’t, he gets testy. Yadda yadda… Hopefully that’s helpful. ]"

How much do you profit off each sale?,"[1&&NeatX3Records&& That varies wildly. Sometimes it’s 100% profit (in the case of budget or dollar stock) Sometimes I lose money, especially if the items in question have lost significant value in between the time I bought it and the time it is sold.

What's a band that you pretend to like so music nerds don't burn your place down?,[2&&NeatX3Records&& Steely Dan ]
Hey - thanks for doing this! I've been thinking about this for some time - it may be a pipe dream but the corporate world is slowly destroying my soul. We've talked about it at home and I have the support to take the plunge if I decide to. A few questions: Is it viable to run a brick & mortar without focusing on used inventory? I feel like I don't know enough to get a sense of what is and isn't a good used purchase. Forgive such a basic question...but does new stock come directly from labels or are you primarily dealing with a distributor? Is it multiple distributors or do these businesses largely cover 90% of the releases? Do you do much for online sales outside of a Discogs store? Do you have any recommendations on inventory management / POS systems? What kind of margins are you typically making on new inventory? I have to imagine your discount rates probably aren't justifying a lot of movement when you're up against Target / Urban Outfitter / Best Buy spends from the same distributors? I have a million more questions but I'll pause it there. I expect I'd be taking a significant pay cut...but again the constant pressure of managing a corporate business focused purely on NR growth and EBITA stability is absolutely exhausting.,"[1&&NeatX3Records&& Like I said before, the worst day working for yourself is better than the best day working for someone else. To answer your questions: I suppose you could? But my question would be , why would you? There are literally millions of records out there waiting to be sold to a new collector. The profit margin in used is vastly better than new records, and I can’t tell you how many of my customers trade in “old” stuff (sometimes still sealed, I swear) to get something else. Also, you will have a significant portion of your client base that ONLY buy used records (frequently they are chasing down a specific pressing of something) The used business is what keeps your rent paid and the lights on. The only store I know of that is 100% new titles is Rough Trade NYC. 2. I try to buy new stock as direct as possible. That means setting up relationships with everyone from Sub Pop and Merge to Jackpot, Roachleg and Triple B. I also buy from what I think of as “mid level” distributors like Secretly Canadian, Redeye, Midheaven, Rev, places like that. Those generally have a “Shtick” that they stay in (like Rev is mostly punk and hardcore, Secretly is mostly indie rock… etc) Then you have One Stop distribution. They carry just about everything. Those would be Alliance, All Media Supply and Ingram. 3. All of my online business is via Discogs. Every so often I’ll do something on my Big Cartel page, but that’s mostly preorders. 4. I was a long time Lightspeed user, and then I found out about Thunder POS. It’s fabulous. It taps into the Discogs Database to build inventory. That alone is worth the price of admission 5. Bigger stores MAY get a better deal on product than I do, but also keep in mind they are willing to make much less (or even lose money) to get people in the door. UO and other chains (like Newbury Comics, Target, Walmart, etc) can also pony up for exclusive colors (which you could too, if you were willing to buy 500+ copies of a single LP) So, long story short, I tend to not buy titles that those places dig in really hard on. I’m not going to be able to be competitive there, so I compete by being a place where people can come find new things, find their next favorite album that they’ve never heard of, and by being the best store I can be with what I have at my disposal. There are LOTS of reasons my clients come to me, and it’s rarely based solely on price. ]"

So far, what we're seeing is that when you give people more free time, they do disgustingly wholesome things things with: more child care, time with family, etc. But there are economies that adopt shorter hours in part to stimulate consumption (China in the 1990s is the great recent example).

Due to warehouses almost needing 24/7 work around the clock, you're really just answering the question of ""how can I cover all times of the day"" and they did 4 10 hour days. But had 3 separate shift types. 1st and 2nd shift shared these types while 3rd was different. 1a or 2a was sunday to wednesday. 1b or 2b was Wednesday to Saturday. And 1 or 2 without the a or b signifier worked monday tuesday thursday friday. 3rd shift however worked friday to monday. This allowed our shift to effectively overlap on harsh days and prevent excessive overtime. No one had to stay past their 10 hours because someone was already there to touch what you didn't finish. If we ever did overtime it was just an extra 10 hour day. Mandatories were few and far between but voluntary OT was always on the table if anyone wanted it. ]"

They had a banner couple months, broke sales records, but the GM who introduced it left and their replacement seems to have killed off the program. Here's GM James Boening talking about it: We have gone to, which is everybody’s going to be like, “What are you talking about?” We went to a four day work week. It doesn’t matter if you’re a sales manager, it doesn’t matter if you’re a GSM, it doesn’t matter if you’re a salesperson, an FNI manager, it doesn’t matter. I mean, everyone is on a four day work week. I will tell you, to give three days full days off a week in this industry, it’s unheard of.Everyone’s like, “Okay, how did you pull that off?” It’s very interesting. I found some weird dynamics. How I was able to do it is I found out I actually have more people here during a longer period of time than trying to break everybody up over an amount of time. It was very interesting, so the coverage is actually more, and I have more time off for my team. We don’t go, “Okay, it’s the last week of the month. Guess what? I need everyone here bell to bell.” We don’t do that either. We don’t do any of the old traditional things. I mean, as a matter of fact, I’ve tried to break every single old mold possible. Even with pay plans where even my managers and my salespeople, I’m super transparent. We’re like, “Okay, we’re going to pay everybody on every last red cent.

Our motors are 99% efficient which is significantly more than standard electric motors, the aerodynamic drag on our car is half that compared to a Tesla and the car only weights 580kg. All of these things mean that it is effectively “sipping” energy as it drives. Not to mention the impact of solar as well, obviously being a solar car – we estimate that for the world record, the solar increased our range of approximately 30% which is a huge help. And to top that off, our battery is only 38kWhs. So we’re able to achieve a range of double a Tesla with close to half the battery size which we’re pretty proud of. A Tesla model S has an energy consumption of 20kWhs/100km, Sunswift 7 has is 3.8kWh/100km. -Andrea ]"

Two parents who are clearly sociopaths - And have a record of abuse weren't even vetted, and are wholly unreliable witnesses. I have never quite seen the pantomime act that was put on by the father, but it's hard to understand why anyone with a heart would act the way he did in those meetings with his lawyer - And he is so narcissistic that he thought this made him look like a victim as well. This is the biggest shit sandwich and eff you that anyone could have given to a victim of abuse. There is so much more that I could say and support, but I don't think anything would come of it besides myself getting banned. I will say this tough - It's clear that nobody except these people described by the Barnetts in a pejorative manner (the white trash comments) ever gave a shit about that little girl. A psychotic adoptive mom from hell, and a spineless lizard of a father who despite his own words war clearly only focused on the image others had of him. This case should and will go down in infamy for the failures of the shepherds to protect the flock. The worst of the worst. ]"

But, I ALWAYS believed she was a child just from her pictures. Another reason, unfortunately, I know all about very early puberty. I told my Mom at age 7 my chest hurt. She felt little lumps. She spoke to my grandma on my Dad's side. She told my Mom to take me to a gynaecologist. She and all my Dad's aunts started their period at 10. Well, Mom took me to the gyno and yes, he agreed. By 8 I had breasts and I was 8 and a half when I had my 1st period. My heart BROKE for Natalia. Once my 1st period started, I had it continually until 35 when I needed a hysterectomy. So, yes, I do not understand how a doctor would not know this. Why wasn't she taken to a gynaecologist to find out if they were so worried? I believe they adopted her knowing everything. They then didn't want her and they abused and tortured her. I saw the finale of the docuseries. Michael Barnett in my opinion definitely got away with everything and in the end, he was smirking. He mentioned double jeopardy so smuggley. Plus, I was disgusted at the end. So, Kristine appears to want to set up Natalia with an older man. I have had thoughts from the beginning especially after they had her reaged to 22 that some form of sexual abuse was going on. I am NOT saying anything did happen, but just how Michael said he was abused because Kristine withheld sex from him. He said he became addicted to porn. He also said he felt too that Natalia broke up his family. He was over at her 1st apartment more than Kristine. Plus at the end of the show when the producer tried to show him sn accusation against him, suddenly he had nothing more to say. I also do not understand why he had to pay $10,000 to the Ukrainian orphanage for restitution? The judge must have felt he wasn't entirely not guilty! Natalia deserved that money. She was abused and tortured by everyone in her life from the moment she came into the United States. Everyone involved should be ashamed and in prison! ]"

There are no experts interviewed, just a lot of hearsay from the Barnetts. The mother was clearly abusive. The father was probably a victim of spousal abuse for most of his marriage. That’s no excuse, he should have intervened on multiple occasions, when he knew Kristine was abusing Natalia. It’s impossible to know what goes on behind closed doors, but the peek we got into their window, left me thinking they both need professional help. He tries to pretend that they had an idyllic life, prior to the adoption, but I find that hard to believe. He is so insecure, that he actually bragged about how many couches they owned! When Kristine filmed Natalia being chastised, it was sickening. I have not seen the finale yet, either. I am disappointed with the way this documentary was done.

The parents are control-freak weirdos. I couldn’t believe they were mad at the psych hospital and were like “well, they said she needed inpatient and they won’t keep her more than a month wtf.” First off, a month is a long time for acute inpatient, but more importantly, they discharged her because they were afraid she would be SA’d there (a very valid concern), and the parents didn’t care at all about that. Sick. Edit: I wrote this before seeing the last two episodes (with more info about her true age) after the donut scene pissed me off and now do believe Natalia was 6 years old. The media really messed this story up on how they reported it from 2018-2022, and I was severely misinformed! ]"

Typically in childhood it would be oppositional defiant disorder, which can later be diagnosed as conduct disorder or antisocial. ODD in itself imo is super problematic (often pathologizing a child for their trauma history/environment) but it is also something which has specific interventions that can resolve many symptoms (but it relies on the caregivers/environment).

As with all documentary series like this one you expect them to be impartial, that each side is given a similar amount of bias or non bias, they should be free from such obvious discrepancies & that relevant facts of the case are clear that wasn't the case with this documentary. The allegations or the claims that are been made throughout the series are so disturbing whether they're true,false, made up or are a bit of all three they deserve not only to be investigated thoroughly but to be explained in the simplest way possible.

"I agree with you. It was so frustrating trying to figure things out in the first few episodes. But, I ALWAYS believed she was a child just from her pictures. Another reason, unfortunately, I know all about very early puberty. I told my Mom at age 7 my chest hurt. She felt little lumps. She spoke to my grandma on my Dad's side. She told my Mom to take me to a gynaecologist. She and all my Dad's aunts started their period at 10. Well, Mom took me to the gyno and yes, he agreed. By 8 I had breasts and I was 8 and a half when I had my 1st period. My heart BROKE for Natalia. Once my 1st period started, I had it continually until 35 when I needed a hysterectomy. So, yes, I do not understand how a doctor would not know this. Why wasn't she taken to a gynaecologist to find out if they were so worried? I believe they adopted her knowing everything. They then didn't want her and they abused and tortured her. I saw the finale of the docuseries. Michael Barnett in my opinion definitely got away with everything and in the end, he was smirking. He mentioned double jeopardy so smuggley. Plus, I was disgusted at the end. So, Kristine appears to want to set up Natalia with an older man. I have had thoughts from the beginning especially after they had her reaged to 22 that some form of sexual abuse was going on. I am NOT saying anything did happen, but just how Michael said he was abused because Kristine withheld sex from him. He said he became addicted to porn. He also said he felt too that Natalia broke up his family. He was over at her 1st apartment more than Kristine. Plus at the end of the show when the producer tried to show him sn accusation against him, suddenly he had nothing more to say.

Remember all his questions about where she had gone when he discovered she wasn't inside the apartment? It wasn't the donuts per se that upset him. It was the fact that she had left the apartment and made contact with a friendly person. That's why the mother had coached Natalia on what to say when she met people. She was supposed to state her age as that of an adult and to state that she was dangerous and should not be trusted. It was all to discredit the child from the get go, and to keep people away from her. They also kept wiping her phone to keep her from having contact with the outside world.

"The reason he was so concerned about the donuts was because he knew she had no way to get them on her own and therefore, they had to have come from someone else. The Barnetts' biggest fear was that Natalia would have contact with others whom she could speak to of their abuse or who could attest to their neglect first hand. Remember all his questions about where she had gone when he discovered she wasn't inside the apartment? It wasn't the donuts per se that upset him. It was the fact that she had left the apartment and made contact with a friendly person. That's why the mother had coached Natalia on what to say when she met people. She was supposed to state her age as that of an adult and to state that she was dangerous and should not be trusted. It was all to discredit the child from the get go, and to keep people away from her. They also kept wiping her phone to keep her from having contact with the outside world. I am convinced that the second apartment with all those stairs was chosen because they'd hoped the stairs would be a physical barrier to keep her inside and isolated.

What’s wild is I followed this case in the news and through true crime coverage over the last few years since it became well-known, and so much of what was in this documentary was not in any of that coverage (that I saw). All the prior info made it seem like natalia’s age was not concrete and murky.

I believe I read that they had paid for one surgery for her, but did not want to be saddled with any further medical expenses on the child's behalf. When the Ciccones decided they'd rather abandon her than pay for her medical expenses, as the various prospective adoptive parents in the documentary state, the Ciccone's even tried to recoup the cost of the medical bills they'd incurred while she was with them by making their reimbursement part of the new adoption agreement. So if they had adopted or given birth to a child that did not develop medical issues until after the fact, what would their plan have been then? Would they be planning to sell that child off as well, or to try to return it like a broken toaster??? Furthermore, their only requirement in re-homing this child was that they get the cost of their medical expenditures back. It was all about the money. They didn't care where or with whom the child ended up, as long as the person could pay. And that's how she ended up with the abusive Barnetts. ]"

They believed she was an adult because the mother had coached Natalia to tell people on meeting them that she was an adult and to also state that she was dangerous and had tried to harm her family. This was meant to keep people who might otherwise help or believe Natalia, or report the parents to CPS, at bay. And seriously ask yourself if you would ever expect any child to move into your apartment complex on their own. No you would not. You would assume she was an adult simply by virtue of the fact that she had passed the rental process. Yes, she was needy because, unbeknownst to her neighbors, she was actually a minor child who'd been abandoned and was living alone. Add her disability to that and she was needy to the max. Also, it seems clear that the poor child had suffered some sexual abuse in her past and was acting out. I also think the lack of hygiene and teaching of hygiene skills was part of Kristine's plan to keep people away from her. All of this combined served to repel the neighbors, and believing she was an adult, they quickly lost their patience with her. I think most, if not all, of them truly believed she was an adult.

Not a lot of info on it and I was like dang! Recently when I saw it pop up on HBO Max then youtubers were covering it, I decided to watch a couple of creators who pop up in my algorithim/feedback loop. They were both in the middle on this. So then when my favorite true crime youtuber covered it, I had to watch. I have to say I was a little surprised that she was weary of everybody involved from the get go. So, then I watched the documentary. I have to say from the start this guy got on my nerves. I agree he is so histrionic and contradicts himself a lot. I felt suspicious of both sides, but the videos of the interrogation of Natalia were very suspect. She obviously looked like a child who didn't know what to do or how to please her new parents. I kept thinking why were her previous adoptive parents so hell bent on getting rid of her, which caused some doubt. But I'm not liking this guy more and more nevermind the 14 couches flex. I still had questions about the no accent and only being in US for short period and still do. I did think the shutting down after the person speaking Ukranian to her could be traumatic if she was abused in the orphanage like she probably was. I immediately felt she was abused since she was using sexually suggestive language to men. I was initially suspicious of the new family because I've witnessed the keeping children for government money scam (like the lady with the 5 children 9 cats and so on living in ""white trash"" town), but Natalia seems to have thrived being with them. She seems so much more confident and well adjusted, so my hat goes off the them. So in my opinion, these are two messed up individuals who messed up not only Natalia, but their own children as well (the genius who they took all the credit for should be working for NASA or SpaceX but is living in his dad's basement and obviously traumatized).

Two parents who are clearly sociopaths - And have a record of abuse weren't even vetted, and are wholly unreliable witnesses. I have never quite seen the pantomime act that was put on by the father, but it's hard to understand why anyone with a heart would act the way he did in those meetings with his lawyer - And he is so narcissistic that he thought this made him look like a victim as well. This is the biggest shit sandwich and eff you that anyone could have given to a victim of abuse. There is so much more that I could say and support, but I don't think anything would come of it besides myself getting banned. I will say this tough - It's clear that nobody except these people described by the Barnetts in a pejorative manner (the white trash comments) ever gave a shit about that little girl. A psychotic adoptive mom from hell, and a spineless lizard of a father who despite his own words war clearly only focused on the image others had of him. This case should and will go down in infamy for the failures of the shepherds to protect the flock. The worst of the worst.","[-3&&OldChampionship2010&& Sorry, how exactly have you concluded that the girl is blameless here? ]"

It's human nature.

Complex it is, but not at all in a natural state, but by deception. The juxtaposition of the words compared to their actions from those people laid bare their true character - And nobody twisted their arm. ]"

However, the fact that an officer with the sex trafficking division had interviewed Freddy about the whole message exchange and asked him if he had been sexual with Natalia (and even said quote ""even if you kissed her, I need to know"") leads me to believe that the police also found the messages to be contextually sexual solicitation -- or near enough to investigate, at least.

The difference here is that surveillance is being used by an occupying power to control an occupied population. In the second episode of the film, we spoke with a former Israeli intelligence officer in the elite Unit 8200. You might find what he told us instructive: ""The secrecy around 8200 and the intelligence community in general, helps it avoid public inspection. It has this image of only collecting information, only preventing terrorism and so on. Only diminishing violence, not in any way perpetuating it. But that's not true, as we know from other military regimes around the world. Intelligence is an integral part of a forced control over people."" When I asked him how important surveillance was in sustaining Israel's occupation and apartheid practices, here's what he said: ""Crucial. Essential. Couldn't continue one day without intelligence. It’s like a deteriorating situation where you have to use more and more force to keep the same level of control. So in the end, it's going to explode. I mean, it cannot keep going. There's a limit to the force you can use."" ]"

At the moment, stem cell therapy is an experimental option for hair loss. There is still ongoing research on its effectiveness. While some studies have shown stem cell therapy might be able to promote hair growth and greater hair density, additional research is needed to confirm these results. Stem cells are pluripotential cells which mean they can change to create different tissues. Hair stem cells have been a subject of many studies. We know stem cells could be used to make new hair in certain conditions. This has not been fully researched for safety and is not being practiced currently. However, stem cells from other areas such as fat tissue have been harvested and injected into the scalp to stimulate the hair growth. At this point, we don't have enough solid evidence that this procedure can help hair growth. ]"

The suggestion that the results might not be as good as a more traditional procedure could be related to the fact that only a limited number of grafts can be transplanted per session.

For example a pharmacist refusing to fill a prescribed birth control or sell Plan B because they are against it personally.,"[6&&DzRythen&& I've talked about this with my pharmacists, we're all of the same mind. It's not our job to impose our own morals onto patients, we shouldn't get in between them and their doctor. It's our responsibility to dispense prescriptions and that's what we should do. So yeah, I think that's wrong. With that said there are plenty of instances where the pharmacist catches something wrong with a prescription, perhaps it interacts negetivly with something their taking or for some other reason would be unsafe for them to take. Usually we contact the doctor and sort it out with them before the patient comes to pick it up, sometimes though it means they need to wait longer. If a pharmacist chooses not to dispense something for a medical reason based on their judgment, I think that's fair. There's also safety reasons to do so, we don't dispense schedule II controlled substances without photo ID for instance. That's not the law but it's what our pharmacy manager feels comfortable doing. I also think that's fair. ]"

The really bad mistakes of filling with the wrong drug or selling the wrong prescription to someone I can't see happening often because of the pharmacist checking our work and built in safeguards with our computer system. ]

The cool thing about making puppets is that we can choose literally whatever we want to make them.

In order to make an ethical puppet, just make sure you are using ethical materials. Materials that necessitate or promote abuse and murder of others are not ethical materials. ]"

The point is that he's an anthropomorphic bird who teaches kids how to spell and count. The parents of those kids could not give a flying whether Big Bird's feathers are real, or plastic, or made of solid gold. They're watching a show with their kids, not trying to hone a political stance on animal cruelty. There's a time and place for it and it's not while your child is learning shapes and colours. I'd be overjoyed if they found an alternative material to make the costume. But it doesn't make a difference to anyone watching the show. If you want to educate kids (or parents for that matter) about animal cruelty, there are far, far more effective arenas to have that conversation. Because right now, it just looks like you're trying to call people out and make them feel bad about enjoying a beloved children's show that has been basically nothing but a positive influence in the lives of millions of people. It is a battle you will lose every time, and you'll do it looking like absolute fools for trying to take down a franchise and a brand that is universally loved. Like what's your next target?

"Speaking broadly and generally... When is divorce the right answer? And after divorce, how do you make sure you don't end up in that 60% of failed second marriages?","[28&&peachsoftdrink&& Great questions. In my opinion, divorce is pretty much always the right answer when there is characterological domestic violence. This means that the domestic violence is part of a person's personality, and not confined to situations when conflict spins out of control. My other thoughts such as affairs and addiction would really depend on the context and nuance of the relationship. But, I think characterological DV is a solid reason to divorce 10/10 times. In regards to your second question, my answer is: doing your own personal work to change whatever it is that you contributed to the breakdown of your first marriage. You can't divorce yourself, and whatever bad behavior you had in your first marriage will carry over into the second - unless you actively work to identify it and change that behavior. ]"

There's a huge difference between a batterer, and a person who loses his or her cool during an argument. Characterological domestic violence is highly unlikely to change. Researchers have said it is likely due to early childhood trauma, most likely witnessing the same type of domestic violence between parents. ]"

How much did COVID affect your business numbers?,"[16&&peachsoftdrink&& The short answer is: quite a lot in a positive way. The pandemic did wonders for mental health therapy access in general. It brought telehealth to the table, which meant people in rural parts of the state were able to access therapy services in cities. It was a game changer on a lot of levels. ]"
What are strong predictors of divorce? What are some ways that a couple can minimize chances of divorce before they’re married or even before they’re engaged?,"[17&&peachsoftdrink&& Good question. There are a few that are specific to communication (these usually happen during conflict): Criticism - attacking your partner, blaming your partner, character assassination, questions that aren't real questions but hidden insults. Examples: ""you never pick up after yourself"" or ""what were you thinking?!"" Contempt - acting superior to your partner and/or disgusted by them Stonewalling - a lack of communication, responsiveness, eye contact, physically turning away from them during an argument Defensiveness - either counter-attacking your partner or being an indignant victim Interestingly, going to individual therapy for marital problems also predicts divorce, but the above four are a lot more salient. For couples who are dating or engaged, it's really important to build a culture of appreciation in the relationship. It helps mitigate conflict and builds intimacy. All that means is that partners say thank you to each other for the mundane things as well as the big things. I also recommend partners dedicate an hour a week to talking about the relationship. Discuss what's working, what's not working, share appreciations, and tell the other person how they can make them feel loved this week. ]"

In a country of 8 million people, with 2 psychiatrists, we have started a new psychiatry residency program that was last year accredited by the West African College of Physicians. Separately, but linked, in Eastern Sierra Leone, in Kono, and linked to Koidu Government Hospital, we have developed a continuum of mental health care that includes a range of providers. They go into the community and work with people directly. The heart of this work is non-specialists, that is, community members who provide support at a household level. We are excited to continue this commitment! Learn more: https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/f133e3f4f4a64710ba559944eb10777c ]"

I received little support from my own parents, and drove them nuts with how I struggled to do simple chores until I moved out.

My support comes from a variety of programs. If your sister's disability payment is low enough, she might qualify for a Community First Choice program. That's the program I'm under to afford my place, and another Medicaid program that covers all my Medicare subsidies. All I pay really is a predetermined rent each month, with a given amount left over for... Whatever. If your sister was disabled before she was 26, another important thing to look into is the ABLE program. Long story short, an ABLE account will allow her to have assets without losing benefits. Please hang in there! I know its hard, but I promise, its just as hard on your sister! Above all else, be gentle with her.

I also have high HHV-6 IgM/IgM and high CMV also all lights up positive. Been sickly since I was 14 when had air hunger causing vocal tics and was unfortunately immediately put on a very high dosage of Ativan to take indefinitely. But I was very sickly even before the Ativan. I went from running a 7 minute mile and 4 hour tennis matches to not being able to function much. Now I'm 40 and nearly bedbound with low stamina and POTS. Even though this happened very suddenly in high school I think the way in which it lingered and the anxiety diagnosis has made it so no one has ever seen what I've said all along was the real issue. I even said at the time that Ativan was like my breathing medicine. The only thing it did was make me care less that I wasn't able to breathe well. I never had a pediatrician/PCP etc. There was a lot of neglect. I went straight to a psychiatrist and the evaluation was very perfunctory and the response very authoritarian (was mocked for being afraid of taking Ativan—but my fears ended up being well founded—now told too medically unstable to taper). My PCP doesn't know what to make of my EBV results. He just repeats the tests every once in a while to see if they're still positive, and they always are. An EBV DNA test was done several times and is usually negative but was once at the very low end of reportable. Since the emergence of Long Covid and seeing people's stories on Twitter, I've noted what they are going through matches exactly what happened to me in high school 26 years ago, except that I was not on the Internet and very quickly funneled to psychiatry and benzos. But their description matches what happened to me--including the cognitive. In middle school I had read all of the high school curricula, and by 14 when this started I had to start reading out loud to myself to focus. I never thought it could be ADHD because I was older than normal when it started, but it was like that. My doctor is always swamped and so I don't really get the attention I need. He once tried making a referral to infectious disease when he still had a nurse who could do the leg work, and I was told they rejected seeing me but was never told why. Whatever I do now I need to do of my own accord because I can't even been able get my glucose test strip prescriptions sent in for over a year--the office is just under water and he's near retirement age flying solo. I've never even been told if my EBV results are significant. The testing was first done by another psychiatrist (I no longer see) who tested her entire panel and was selling supplements and I just happened to actually test positive. But the tests have been done many times since then from reputable labs. The reason I wonder if they're significant and at all explain my symptoms is that I know most people would have positive IgG, and I know there are certain disease where the IgM values are meaningless (like in HSV-2). I've asked my doctor if that's the case with this, and he said he doesn't know. It does fit with how sickly I am. I often have a temp. Often have a sore throat. Often flu like. And again the stamina issue along with POTS (I take a beta blocker).f Edit: My ANA is also positive, but I can't remember which ones. But I know ANA can be positive in healthy people (but I am not healthy). ]"

Fibromyalgia, for those who don’t know, is when someone has widespread musculoskeletal pain for >3 months, usually with other symptoms like fatigue, sleep issues and some will have cognitive issues (ex. Brain fog) and/or psychiatric issues. When someone is examined, they have tender areas of soft tissue, lab testing is normal (you test for other diseases than can cause muscular pain to rule them out). If your primary care doctor thinks you might have fibromyalgia, they should refer you to a sub specialist to ensure that you are getting the proper testing to rule out other diseases that mimic fibromyalgia. Anyone with fibromyalgia and another rheumatic disease should have their fibromyalgia diagnosed and managed by their rheumatologist. After diagnosis, your primary care doctor should be able to manage many with fibromyalgia. Note: some primary care doctors have special expertise in FM, these recommendations are just generalizations and might not always hold true, this is ideally what we recommend. We realize that some people cannot get into a rheumatologist and might benefit from starting treatment for FM if their primary practitioner recommends its, and that is fine because many of the treatments have generally low risk and can be monitored and managed by a primary care doctor. However, if possible we recommend at least that your PCP consults with rheumatology if possible and especially if your diagnosis is unclear or you are not responding to treatment. The treatment is: -Education on diagnosis and prognosis -Education on evidence for exercise and other therapies -You will be evaluated for sleep and mood issues and referred or treated for those -Most patients will be offered a trial of medications (these are medications that sometimes are called anticonvulsants or antidepressants but have been found to be effective in fibromyalgia) -Most patients are started on an exercise program For those that don’t respond, we recommend they see a rheumatologist or expert in FM. Combination of medications, referrals to physical therapy, physiatrists, therapists, and multidisciplinary programs focus on FM might be recommended. The best practice is that all patients should be reassured that fibromyalgia is a real illness and is not imagined or in your head. Your practitioner should be able to explain centralized pain to you (nociplastic pain) if you want to have that discussion. FM is an area of active research, especially since some people who have had covid infection are now being diagnosed with FM. This means that the number of people with FM is likely going to increase, and so awareness about the disease is important, since there are evidence based treatments that can be trials. Remember that not everything that is evidence based works for everyone. Everyone is different and that is why its so important to try to build good communication with your practitioners and your illness community. Hope this helps! ]"
What is your thoughts on Fibromyalgia and best effective treatment? Thanks,"[4&&ShinakoX2&& My wife has been dealing with fibro for the last 5 years, so here's my anecdotal suggestions: for pain medication she takes Duloxetine and Pregabalin (or Gabapentin) find a pain specialist to work with. We found one that also specializes in back pain. She had severe pain in her back and SI joint from previous injuries, medications and physical therapy didn't help. She ended up getting nerve ablations in those areas ro help relieve the pain. Hopefully she will be able to do better physical therapy now that she's not exercising with pain. we invested in a Purple mattress with an adjustable base, and that's helped with pain relief and being able to sleep. She also spends most of her time sitting up in bed as that's the most pain free position. pool therapy is the best exercise for relieving pain and keeping mobility. Excercising when you're in pain is difficult, but laying around all day and and having your body stiffen up due to lack of movement will only makes things worse in the long run. Increased weight also puts more strain on the body and increases pain. in addition to increased nerve sensivity/pain one of her symptoms is tight fascia. Heat packs and massages can useful for treating that symptom. She goes to massage therapist about once a month, her fascia tightens back up almost immediately afterwards, but it helps with pain relief. if you have access to cannabis, that's a good option for breakthrough pain. Do online research for the specific strains that are available at the dispensary to find ones that effective for pain. Fibro is a wide diagnosis for unexplained chronic pain, so it will be different for everyone. Some people are able to manage it and leave relatively normal lives. In my wife's case, she's pretty much become legally and medically disabled over the past year. I also highly recommend therapy for caregivers of people with fibromyalgia - caregiver's fatigue/stress/guilt is real. The effects of long term fibro on mental health and marriage is the same as when a spouse is diagnosed with cancer - the main difference being that fibro is not a terminal illness. ]"

"Thank You for the reply. If a patient has tried all the available medication and other options and still in pain, would you recommend them to try tramadol as an option?","[3&&Long_Illness&& Sadly, I can't give medical advice on the forum. Sorry if you are struggling, I have dealt with pain and it is really hard. Personally, I do not love tramadol and the data isn't great. Guidelines recommend against prescribing opioid medications in people with FM. Our pain chapter includes lots of integrative treatment options to trial for pain and non-pharmalogical interventions. You can check it out at your library if you don't want to buy a copy. ]"
"Thank You for the reply. If a patient has tried all the available medication and other options and still in pain, would you recommend them to try tramadol as an option?","[3&&bradslamdunk&& I would advise against opioids as well as a non doctor, so you can take my word with a grain of salt, or just as a n=1 sample size. Tramadol initially helped me with my pain, but I in the end very much contributed to a chronic pain condition. I only took 1-2 pills a day but became dependent on them due to the increased amount of pain I felt when I was off them, and that became a vicious cycle. 6 years later I finally decided to get off and dealt with the worst 2 weeks of pain I’ve ever felt…and suddenly it VANISHED. I felt better than before, as I have also done countless hours of PT, exercise, therapy, etc. also to note with that, I do not have ME/fibro, so I was luckily able to partake in more activities to try and help abate the pain. The point I’m trying to make is even though I luckily had to struggle far less than some people, it still was so mentally draining looking for answers when I felt like there was none. If I got to tell my past self to not take tramadol 6 years ago, my past self would have been SO mad — why are they taking this option away from me!? I need to have this and some hope to feel better!’ But in the end it really wasn’t worth it for long term use. Look up how they can contribute to your body’s sensitivity to pain, even if it is momentarily helping pain. ]"

It is merely a resource for ideas on managing your long illness and we specifically address the concerns in your post in our book. Our book completely agrees with the CDC recommendations and NICE guidelines. CBT is a tool that can be used for specific situations, some people with ME/CFS might find it useful, for example if they have insomnia, where CBTi is helpful for some people. No one is suggesting that people use aggressive exercise or therapy to treat or cure their ME/CFS! That is really outdated.

Is there any hope that ME/CFS will be more medically recognized by doctors and healthcare workers in the near future due to the medical recognition of long covid?","[6&&Long_Illness&& Thanks ThoughtCenter87 for your questions! Dr Jobson here. “Why do a lot of doctors not believe that conditions like CFS exist despite them being medically recognized diseases, and how do you get physicians to recognize that patients have such diseases without being brushed off? When things change, that is hard for some people. When things aren’t easily testable, some people are frustrated by that. I can’t speak for these people, because I have never been taught or thought that these were not real diseases. The medical system has a lot of systemic issues that don’t reward, and often penalize, practitioners who provide quality care to patients. Practitioners are burnt out and most do not agree with how the system works. For those who are frustrated with dealing with patients that don’t have a “straightforward” issue (quotes because some things we think are straightforward end up becoming complicated!) or might not even believe something exists - I encourage them to think about what it must be like to be in the patients position. Most practitioners, if given a little time to empathize, will come around. Most practitioners came to medicine because they wanted to help people feel better. The system can make some jaded and come across unkind. I am sorry for that and I am hopeful things will change in the future. It has to, for all of us! ​2. “How do doctors diagnose conditions like CFS which often do not have many physical markers of their presence?” In diseases that do not have a sensitive and specific test, usually there is an organization of experts on the disease that meets and agrees on diagnostic criteria for a disease. These criteria are not static and change as we learn more about diseases. Physicians who have been trained more recently are more likely to include patient groups and patients in these discussions because they are the true experts in the disease experience. This can be very helpful and for example in the ME/CFS community it was patient advocacy that led to changes in recommendations for treatment. For ME/CFS specifically there are several groups that have diagnostic criteria and most practitioners will use one of these sets of criteria to give a diagnosis. It can be helpful to get a second opinion for diagnoses of all kinds. If you have that access, I encourage it. If not, you can ask your practitioner if they can talk to a colleague. Many practitioners do that as part of their general practice before diagnosing someone with a significant disease like ME/CFS, to make sure they aren't missing anything else. 3. “Is there any hope that ME/CFS will be more medically recognized by doctors and healthcare workers in the near future due to the medical recognition of long covid?” Yes, I am hopeful that because there has been a huge increase in numbers of people who have long illness, that research funding will increase. Certainly long covid has been associated with blossoming or unveiling of other conditions that might have been lingering or might be triggered by the covid-19 infection. It’s going to take time to sort it out, but people are working on it. I have hope that the future generations of doctors will be more open minded, patient centered, and aware of the limits of their discipline. ]"

And yes, some people lie, but conditions like CFS are medically documented and exist. In fact there are doctors that specialize in these mysterious conditions - they're rare but CFS specialists are real. So why do doctors still deny the existence of these real diseases if they are in medical texts and are acknowledged in the medical world? Is it because they can't be treated, so doctors would rather dig their heads in the sand and pretend they don't exist instead of acknowledging current scientific literature? Secondly doctors have a lot of pride in their profession. An often touted phrase (for good reason) is that it is evidence based. But there is little evidence for a objective pathophysiological mechanism (something we can see objectively in the body) in these conditions - so we disbelieve they exist.

"We are taught to diagnose and provide management and see people get better - it makes us feel successful and we can pat ourselves on the back. So we hate it when people have disease we cant treat effectively. So we lie yo ourselves that the patients symptoms are made up to protect our ego. Figures as much. And yes, some people lie, but conditions like CFS are medically documented and exist. In fact there are doctors that specialize in these mysterious conditions - they're rare but CFS specialists are real. So why do doctors still deny the existence of these real diseases if they are in medical texts and are acknowledged in the medical world? Is it because they can't be treated, so doctors would rather dig their heads in the sand and pretend they don't exist instead of acknowledging current scientific literature? Secondly doctors have a lot of pride in their profession. An often touted phrase (for good reason) is that it is evidence based. But there is little evidence for a objective pathophysiological mechanism (something we can see objectively in the body) in these conditions - so we disbelieve they exist. The mechanism exists, it's just that there hasn't been enough research into these conditions, so the mechanism isn't known. Maybe if the existence of the conditions stopped being denied so often because ""oh the mechanism doesn't exist because we've yet to see it"" there'd be more research poured into these conditions to discover the specific pathophysiological mechanism behind them.

Lots of “professionals” are just quacks looking to make money off people. You definitely need to be wary of people you pay for diagnosis and treatment. A slightly related example might be - ADHD diagnosis are shooting through the roof right now because people go to private clinics for labels to their subjective poorly defined non specific symptoms and then they get a lifetime supply of amphetamines if noone asks anymore questions. The other issue is obviously that doctors are ignorant sometimes - they havent read all the latest evidence and papers in relation to each condition. Patients have the time and interest to read at lenght about their condition. But as a professional if you are ignorant you need to admit that and maintain a humble attitude - dont be an arrogant doosche you dont know everything. But also patients who dont have medical training need to be wary of the sources they use for reading. You can read any theory you like online. You can read the earth is flat if you like. In response to your second paragraph - yes research into conditions causing significant mortality and morbidity should be done. What mechanisms or theories are you aware of for cfs? I do find the condition interesting from an ethical and philosophical psychological standpoint ]

"What does it mean if an EBV panel all four test results have very high results every single time you test? I also have high HHV-6 IgM/IgM and high CMV also all lights up positive. Been sickly since I was 14 when had air hunger causing vocal tics and was unfortunately immediately put on a very high dosage of Ativan to take indefinitely. But I was very sickly even before the Ativan. I went from running a 7 minute mile and 4 hour tennis matches to not being able to function much. Now I'm 40 and nearly bedbound with low stamina and POTS. Even though this happened very suddenly in high school I think the way in which it lingered and the anxiety diagnosis has made it so no one has ever seen what I've said all along was the real issue. I even said at the time that Ativan was like my breathing medicine. The only thing it did was make me care less that I wasn't able to breathe well. I never had a pediatrician/PCP etc. There was a lot of neglect. I went straight to a psychiatrist and the evaluation was very perfunctory and the response very authoritarian (was mocked for being afraid of taking Ativan—but my fears ended up being well founded—now told too medically unstable to taper). My PCP doesn't know what to make of my EBV results. He just repeats the tests every once in a while to see if they're still positive, and they always are. An EBV DNA test was done several times and is usually negative but was once at the very low end of reportable. Since the emergence of Long Covid and seeing people's stories on Twitter, I've noted what they are going through matches exactly what happened to me in high school 26 years ago, except that I was not on the Internet and very quickly funneled to psychiatry and benzos. But their description matches what happened to me--including the cognitive. In middle school I had read all of the high school curricula, and by 14 when this started I had to start reading out loud to myself to focus. I never thought it could be ADHD because I was older than normal when it started, but it was like that. My doctor is always swamped and so I don't really get the attention I need. He once tried making a referral to infectious disease when he still had a nurse who could do the leg work, and I was told they rejected seeing me but was never told why. Whatever I do now I need to do of my own accord because I can't even been able get my glucose test strip prescriptions sent in for over a year--the office is just under water and he's near retirement age flying solo. I've never even been told if my EBV results are significant. The testing was first done by another psychiatrist (I no longer see) who tested her entire panel and was selling supplements and I just happened to actually test positive. But the tests have been done many times since then from reputable labs. The reason I wonder if they're significant and at all explain my symptoms is that I know most people would have positive IgG, and I know there are certain disease where the IgM values are meaningless (like in HSV-2). I've asked my doctor if that's the case with this, and he said he doesn't know. It does fit with how sickly I am. I often have a temp. Often have a sore throat. Often flu like. And again the stamina issue along with POTS (I take a beta blocker).f Edit: My ANA is also positive, but I can't remember which ones. But I know ANA can be positive in healthy people (but I am not healthy).","[-6&&Long_Illness&& Thank you for sharing lorazepamproblems.

It's a good jumping off point with lots of references to other materials and sources of material we recommend based on our experience as physicians, friends, moms, and patients ourselves. While I can't interpret tests for you or give medical advice without being your physician, These days you can order medical tests over the internet and take them in the comfort of your own home. It is easy to get data about your body: DNA tests, stool microbiome, allergy tests. But what do the results actually mean? How do they affect your life? We talk about testing in our book. Your practitioner should be able to explain why they are ordering a test and be able to interpret the results. If they are unable to interpret it, they need to send you to a specialist who can. That is why many tests are only ordered by certain specialists. When they get the results they have the expertise to go through your results and look at your symptoms and history and make decisions about what the test results mean. Good luck to you and I hope you find someone who can go through your results with you. Message your practitioner and ask if you can have an appointment just to go through your results.

Listing every right that a constitution should protect is hard. American constitution drafters often list a few famous rights such as freedom of speech, protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, and free exercise of religion, plus a handful of others. But there are an infinite number of rights a constitution could protect. However many rights are put in a constitution, others are going to be left out. So what is a constitution drafter to do? Luckily, early in American history a few drafters found an easier way: an “etcetera clause.” It states that there are other rights beyond those specifically listed. The most famous etcetera clause is the Ninth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which states: “The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.” Yet scholars are divided on whether the Ninth Amendment itself actually does protect unenumerated rights, and the Supreme Court has almost entirely ignored it. Regardless of what the Ninth Amendment means, however, things are much clearer when it comes to state constitutions. Two-thirds of state constitutions have equivalent provisions, or “Baby Ninth Amendments,” worded similarly to the Ninth Amendment. This book is the story of how the “Baby Ninths” came to be, what they mean, and what they tell us about unenumerated rights more generally. Unlike the controversy surrounding the Ninth Amendment, the meaning of the Baby Ninths is straightforward: they protect individual rights that are not otherwise enumerated. They are an “etcetera, etcetera” at the end of a bill of rights. This book argues that state judges should do their duty and live up to their own constitutions to protect the rights “retained by the people” that these “etcetera clauses” are designed to guarantee. The fact that Americans have adopted these provisions so many times in so many states demonstrates that unenumerated rights are not only protected by state constitutions, but that they are popular. Unenumerated rights are not a weird exception to American constitutional law. They are at the center of it. We should start treating constitutions accordingly.

"What is the consensus in the judiciary on what constitutes a ""good reason"" for regulating rights?

"What is the consensus in the judiciary on what constitutes a ""good reason"" for regulating rights? And what are some viewpoints where disagreements arise on what is a ""good reason"" or not?","[8&&IrritableGourmet&& Not OP, but the judiciary uses different defined levels of ""scrutiny"" to determine when a right can be infringed, each with their own set of guidelines. For example, To satisfy the strict scrutiny standard, the law or policy must: be justified by a compelling governmental interest. While the Courts have never brightly defined how to determine if an interest is compelling, the concept generally refers to something necessary or crucial, as opposed to something merely preferred. Examples include national security, preserving the lives of a large number of individuals, and not violating explicit constitutional protections. be narrowly tailored to achieve that goal or interest. If the government action encompasses too much (overbroad) or fails to address essential aspects of the compelling interest, then the rule is not considered narrowly tailored. be the least restrictive means for achieving that interest: there must not be a less restrictive way to effectively achieve the compelling government interest. The test will be met even if there is another method that is equally the least restrictive. Some legal scholars consider this ""least restrictive means"" requirement part of being narrowly tailored, but the Court generally evaluates it separately. ]"

The problem is you can never list every right you want protected because there literally are an infinite number of them. Every specific exercise of your liberty could be considered a right.

A gallon was legal, so the court thought the difference was arbitrary. I also really like the case Thiede v. Town of Scandia Valley (Minnesota 1944) which recognized the right to establish a home.

But, when they use a personalized voice that sounds more like them, they say they’re less likely to get hung up on. — Amanda ]"

How good do you expect the tech to be and how will it be applied in a few years?,"[2&&washingtonpost&& I’ve seen a really wide variety in terms of exactly how good this technology is right now for patients using voice recreation services. Part of it depends on how good the recordings used to clone someone’s voice are — whether they’re clear, crisp, and the person is speaking consistently in a way that is easily read by AI — as well as what sort of equipment they used to record themselves. Another part of it depends on what company you use and exactly how much input you give the computer. Generally, if someone records more sentences/phrases, they have gotten better results, but not always. I’ve interviewed people who thought that their re-created voice sounded terrible with one company, but loved how it sounded with another. It probably also depends on what sort of data a company has on different accents and types of speakers. One company might have a great algorithm for British accents but might not have a good algorithm for Irish accents. And, there’s still a long way to go in terms of getting synthetic voices to mimic emotion or natural cadence in speech. ALS patients who use the technology said it still felt more robotic, even though it sounded more like them. They’re hopeful that the technology gets better in the future so that they can sound even more like themselves, and possibly use AI-generated voices that can express emotions like sarcasm, sadness or excitement. — Amanda ]"
How good do you expect the tech to be and how will it be applied in a few years?,"[2&&washingtonpost&& This is a great question that’s unfortunately hard to answer. Many AI voice experts acknowledge that AI voice cloning software is much better now than it was even one or two years ago. But they also say it’s not perfect — with some scientists telling me it’s “80 percent there,” and there’s still room to go in creating the perfect clone (if that’s even possible). People who’ve had their voice cloned still say their replicated voices sound robotic “and just not like me.” Experts predict in the next few years we could get that number up to “90 percent,” but that would require a few things to happen: we’d need more training data, which in this case are libraries of voices, and they’d have to include troves of voices that aren’t well represented in training sets now, such as Mandarin and Arabic speaking dialects. The future users span the gamut. Hollywood has already started using the technology. Val Kilmer lost his natural voice to throat cancer, and AI voice tools were used to replicate his speech in the newest Top Gun movie. On the less rosy side, critics worry that bad-actors will use voice generating technology to clone a politician’s voice to make them say something they never did and release it at a critical moment (such as days before an election.) I’ve already talked with family members who’ve been scammed by swindlers who use AI to clone the voice of a loved one, make them sound in distress, and then asking their family to send over thousands of dollars. — Pranshu ]"

"Good question. Some of it I’ve answered in my previous comments, but the point about varying combustion points is really interesting. I was amazed to learn during our reporting just how destructive the heat of a large wildfire can be. For instance, one family came back to their rural property near Batemans Bay, about four hours’ drive south of Sydney, to find everything in their metal shed had been burnt through. Even iron tools designed for branding had been melted and reduced to blobs of molten metal. Enormous gum trees had literally been reduced to powdered lines of white ash on the ground. So I suppose the point is there’s very little that can survive the fury of a large fire. -AW","[5&&[deleted]&& The same thing happened in the fires in the Kinglake area in Victoria a number of years ago. I used to travel up through there a lot before the fires. When the road opened again there was nothing left except for concrete slabs where the houses were, and where the once were cars were blobs of molten metal. It was absolutely surreal. ]"

Anecdotally, as someone who lived through another fire in Australia in 2005 (Wangary bushfire, Eyre Peninsula) that fear is absolutely warranted. Most of the people who died that day were in vehicles, one was a Mum and her kids who got lost in the smoke. One grandfather survived by being under the car while his wife and grandkids died in the same car. I am so lucky that the wind changed before it hit the town I was in, we were on the beach already waiting for it to come and ready to run into the water. ]"
"u/flattopmaker's and u/tim33z's questions made me think of some research that came out about the time of the Black Summer fires that got a lot of attention. Academics at Stanford University studied the impact on children’s cardiovascular systems of smoke from deliberately lit wildfires (typically aiming to reduce fuel load) compared with smoke from wildfires. They found pollutant levels were higher in the kids exposed to wildfires rather than prescribed burns. Worryingly, researchers found “there was a trend toward worsened health outcomes in the wildfire group compared to the prescribed group, including increases in wheezing episodes in those with no prior history of asthma, increases in asthma exacerbations in those with prior asthma, and rises in pulse pressure.” Here’s the research if you’re interested. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6801011/pdf/nihms-1024236.pdf -AW",[1&&FlattopMaker&& thanks very interesting ]

"Animal products get huge amounts of subsidies, produce gets close to nothing",[1&&JamesTheJerk&& Farmers do though... ]
"For one thing you have to remember that cost of production doesn't set prices. Supply and demand set prices. Cost of production just tells you if you are going to keep making this thing or not. Likely subsidies keep the chicken production at the current price level or otherwise factories would start shutting down, reducing the supply...","[1&&JamesTheJerk&& I guess I disagree. If you grow bananas on a banana plantation you'll still grow bananas. Still roughly the same cartage of bananas as well. Supply hasn't changed, demand grows with every new human.

This makes a difference in our modus operandi as we lean massively on loans from banks to make our investments. Also the new EU law (deforestation free) forces us to up our traceability game. This ties into our sales directly AND indirectly into the bank loans. And yes, RSPO palm oil was a good move but has its issues. But a similar (ideally SEGREGATED) certificate chain for other commodities (organic certified, or RA for cocoa, or FSC for wood) can have a big impact. ]"

"At any given moment, what ratio of commodity food crops (corn, wheat, potatoes, etc.) are tied up by contracted production vs. available to the spot market?

B) I know fuck-all about the stock market and even I can see this is dumb. Just to start of with, for example: How is shorting your own product not the definition of insider trading. How is this not a Ponzi scheme. Just to clarify, I saw nothing about this being done in combination with cinemas of anything. I have no clue where any capital in this situation is coming from except for some people betting A and other people betting B.
