It feels a bit cherry picked as a statistic (and depends on how you really define what a country is (does UK losing it's colonies count or not) and what a form of government is), but also I can't really disprove it as every other country I think of had a revolution or was invaded or was liberated from being a colony. Every time I think of another country I find a revolution or civil war or it was founded later than I thought, but surely this is just biased western teachings and there are some other countries I am not aware of that have been in existence since before the start of the 20th century. Can anyone think of some others? ]"

To preface this a bit, i have some background in martial arts. And the type of leg protection that i have is something basically strapped on top of the legs to provide protection from feet to knees. Really lightweight obviously cause it's only used to protect against kicks and not sharp spears. Anyways. As far as i know, different kinds of armors (and even their pieces) were expensive and a person doing non-mounted fighting didn't need leg protection that much and usually wore just leather boots. But let's say someone specifically wanted or needed some protection for their feet. Was there any ""cheap"" options were a person could protect the front of their feet just by strapping something on top of their boots? The things that i found, that are closer to what i was thinking, seems to be called a ""closed greaves"". I also googled ""solleret armor"" and there was picture in pinterest titled ""Medieval Armour Boots V3 ~ 3D Model #91500740 | Pond5"". This is looks pretty much what i was thinking. Right now i'm mainly thinking of medieval armors, but i'd happy to hear if any similar foot protection was used during idifferent times and in other cultures. ]"

He explained how they were lost because a lot of the Irish-speaking musicians were poor and itinerant (the exact sort of people likely to die during a mass-famine) and how a lot of Irish immigrants would choose not to pass on the language to their children, so even if the melodies survived the crossing, after a few generations none of the descendants could understand what the original lyrics meant and so they started bowlderizing them into nonsense that sounded close enough, like a multi-generational game of Telephone.

This made it difficult for America to develop any modern type of progressive political party, and made nominal progressives half-hearted: one hardly knows whether a man such as W. J.

"It is often said that people back in the 900AD era thought the world would end at the first millennium.

Do you think King Edward II, the Plantagenet King of England, was involved in a sexual relationship with Piers Gaveston, whom he appointed 1st Earl of Cornwall? Was he bisexual?","[2&&BookQueen13&& You actually might want to ask these on the askhistorians sub because they might generate some pretty good answers. For your first question, the answer is, basically, we don't know. The idea that the year 1000 was apocalyptical is based on biblical prophecy that argued that there would be an end of time after 5,000 years since the creation of the world. Many modern scholars, beginning with Jules Michelet (circa French Revolution), identified this with the year 1000. But this gets into the thorny issue of how we calculate time: you have to calculate the age of the Erath since creation (according to Christianity, not modern science) by counting backwards based on genealogies, dates, and ages give throughout the Old and New Testaments. This calculation was revised a couple of times in the early middle ages, so there are actually a few dates that work. There's also the issue of how medieval people kept time. The B.C. / A. D. System (which is functionally the same as our modern B.C.E / C.E. system) was just beginning to be used widely in the 10th and 11th centuries, but it was by no means the only way to keep time. Many places reckoned time by regnal years--that is, based on how many years the current king has been king. Other systems reckoned time since creation or since the founding of a city (Roman calendar) or religious movement (Islamic calendar). So, it's difficult to say if your average medieval person would have even conceived of themselves as living in the year 1000. I'd also point out that eschatology and apocalypticim are two separate ideas that are often conflated. Eschatology refers to the belief that there will be an end of time, whereas apocalypse means revelation--i.e. the revelation of God's design for salvation, in this particular context. So an apocalypse does not necessarily mean the end of time. I'm basing a lot of this off what I remember from doing a comp field in medieval apocalytism. I suggest reading Richard Landes' article 'Fear of an Apocalyptic Year 1000: Augustinian Historiography, Medieval and Modern,'. I believe it's available for download for free on jstor. For you second question, I don't much direct knowledge of the subject but secondhand, a friend of mine is working on a book about late medieval royal power in England and her conclusion was that Edward and Peirs were not lovers and that it was political propaganda to discredit the king. She definitely went into the project thinking that they were lovers. ]"

"You always hear about some of the awful war crimes carried out in experiments etc at places like unit 731 during the war, but what were some of the most heinous war crimes and experiments carried out by American, British, Soviet, French forces etc","[3&&elmonoenano&& It's a little different of a situation b/c except for former Axis powers, the western Allies didn't really occupy territory, and when they did it was much more limited. The Germans were in Czechoslovakia and Poland for a long time. There were also legal differences in those regimes. In Poland specifically there were a lot of people, mostly Jewish but Roma and others, who had no legal status. That really didn't exist in the British, French, and US occupation zones. There was no group of people who could just be eradicated and no philosophical idea that it was necessary. I disagree with other posters that the carpet bombing was a war crime. But for US examples, I would look more domestically at people the US had control over. The two big ones would be for the Japanese and Aleut internment. The Aleut internment doesn't get a lot of coverage b/c it was justified as being for the Aleut's safety as opposed to a security response of the Japanese. No one was claiming the Aleuts were disloyal or saboteurs or anything. But the Aleut internment conditions were much worse than the conditions the Japanese Americans were kept in. That led to a higher rate of death, but the population was much smaller so at first glance it doesn't look that bad. Only about 88 people died out of 900ish interned, but it was 10% of those interned, vs. 1.3% for the Japanese. Part of that is b/c they were so far away in Alaska and it was kind of an out of sight/out of mind issue. The biggest thing akin to a war crime, and pretty much all parties except the Germans were responsible for this one, was the forced migration of Germans at the end of the war. It was the largest forced migration in world history until Partition. Estimates are around 14.5 million people were expelled from surrounding countries, with death estimates of around 1.5 million people. It still doesn't get much attention b/c Germans had used the existence of minority German populations as justifications for invading other countries and starting the war. No one wanted to leave that excuse available to the Germans again. And b/c basically every country in continental Europe was engaging in it, no one wants to accuse anyone for being inhumane b/c they were almost certainly engaged in the same activities. ]"

A lot of the stuff that people find horrific about the allies bombing was basically their adaptation of the blitz on Coventry in August of 1940. Combing the explosive with a following wave of incendiary bombing that caused the Dresden and Tokyo fire storms was an adaptation of the tactics used first used by the Luftwaffe on Coventry. Early in the war carpet bombing of cities was actually called Coventrying. The Germans just lost too many planes to keep attempting the tactic after the Battle of Britain. The bombing of Guernica was just a normal bombing and the reason it was shocking was it was one of the first. But the key to carpet bombing is to use the combination of explosive bombs to blow open roofs and then incendiary devices to start fires within those buildings that would destroy the contents, and if you were lucky, spread the fire.

"Are there any similar books to Guns, Germs and Steel or Sapiens?","[2&&AutoModerator&& Hi! It looks like you are talking about the book Guns, Germs, and Steel by Jared Diamond. The book over the past years has become rather popular, which is hardly surprising since it is a good and entertaining read. It has reached the point that for some people it has sort of reached the status of gospel. On r/history we noticed a trend where every time a question was asked that has even the slightest relation to the book a dozen or so people would jump in and recommend the book. Which in the context of history is a bit problematic and the reason this reply was written. Why it is problematic can be broken down into two reasons: In academic history there isn't such thing as one definitive authority or work on things. There are often others who research the same subjects and people that dive into work of others to build on it or to see if it indeed holds up. This being critical of your sources and not relying on one source is actually a very important skill in studying history often lacking when dozens of people just spam the same work over and over again as a definite guide and answer to ""everything"". There are a good amount of modern historians and anthropologists who are quite critical of Guns, Germs, and Steel and there are some very real issues with Diamond's work. These issues are often overlooked or not noticed by the people reading his book. Which is understandable, given the fact that for many it will be their first exposure to the subject. Considering the popularity of the book it is also the reason that we felt it was needed to create this response. In an ideal world, every time the book was posted in r/history, it would be accompanied by critical notes and other works covering the same subject. Lacking that a dozen other people would quickly respond and do the same. But simply put, that isn't always going to happen and as a result, we have created this response so people can be made aware of these things. Does this mean that the r/history mods hate the book or Diamond himself? No, if that was the case, we would simply instruct the bot to remove every mention of it. This is just an attempt to bring some balance to a conversation that in popular history had become a bit unbalanced. It should also be noted that being critical of someone's work isn't the same as outright dismissing it. Historians are always critical of any work they examine, that is part of their core skill set and key in doing good research. Below you'll find a list of other works covering much of the same subject. Further below you'll find an explanation of why many historians and anthropologists are critical of Diamonds work. Other works covering the same and similar subjects. Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest 1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus Last Days of the Inca Epidemics and Enslavement: Biological Catastrophe in the Native Southeast, 1492-1715 The Great Divergence Why the West Rules for Now Ecological Imperialism: The Biological Expansion of Europe, 900-1900 Criticism of Guns, Germs, and Steel Many historians and anthropologists believe Diamond plays fast and loose with history by generalizing highly complex topics to provide an ecological/geographical determinist view of human history. There is a reason historians avoid grand theories of human history: those ""just so stories"" don't adequately explain human history. It's true however that it is an entertaining introductory text that forces people to look at world history from a different vantage point. That being said, Diamond writes a rather oversimplified narrative that seemingly ignores the human element of history. Cherry-picked data while ignoring the complexity of issues In his chapter ""Lethal Gift of Livestock"" on the origin of human crowd infections he picks 5 pathogens that best support his idea of domestic origins. However, when diving into the genetic and historic data, only two pathogens (maybe influenza and most likely measles) could possibly have jumped to humans through domestication. The majority were already a part of the human disease load before the origin of agriculture, domestication, and sedentary population centers. This is an example of Diamond ignoring the evidence that didn't support his theory to explain conquest via disease spread to immunologically naive Native Americas. A similar case of cherry-picking history is seen when discussing the conquest of the Inca. Pizarro's military advantages lay in the Spaniards' steel swords and other weapons, steel armor, guns, and horses... Such imbalances of equipment were decisive in innumerable other confrontations of Europeans with Native Americans and other peoples. The sole Native Americans able to resist European conquest for many centuries were those tribes that reduced the military disparity by acquiring and mastering both guns and horses. This is a very broad generalization that effectively makes it false. Conquest was not a simple matter of conquering a people, raising a Spanish flag, and calling ""game over."" Conquest was a constant process of negotiation, accommodation, and rebellion played out through the ebbs and flows of power over the course of centuries. Some Yucatan Maya city-states maintained independence for two hundred years after contact, were ""conquered"", and then immediately rebelled again. The Pueblos along the Rio Grande revolted in 1680, dislodged the Spanish for a decade, and instigated unrest that threatened the survival of the entire northern edge of the empire for decades to come. Technological ""advantage"", in this case guns and steel, did not automatically equate to battlefield success in the face of resistance, rough terrain and vastly superior numbers.

In the book it seems to be case of the Inka being conquered when Pizarro says they were conquered. Uncritical examining of the historical record surrounding conquest Being critical of the sources you come across and being aware of their context, biases and agendas is a core skill of any historian. Pizarro, Cortez and other conquistadores were biased authors who wrote for the sole purpose of supporting/justifying their claim on the territory, riches and peoples they subdued. To do so they elaborated their own sufferings, bravery, and outstanding deeds, while minimizing the work of native allies, pure dumb luck, and good timing. If you only read their accounts you walk away thinking a handful of adventurers conquered an empire thanks to guns and steel and a smattering of germs. No historian in the last half century would be so naive to argue this generalized view of conquest, but European technological supremacy is one keystone to Diamond's thesis so he presents conquest at the hands of a handful of adventurers. The construction of the arguments for GG&S paints Native Americans specifically, and the colonized world in general, as categorically one step behind. To believe the narrative you need to view Native Americans as somehow naive, unable to understand Spanish motivations and desires, unable react to new weapons/military tactics, unwilling to accommodate to a changing political landscape, incapable of mounting resistance once conquered, too stupid to invent the key technological advances used against them, and doomed to die because they failed to build cities, domesticate animals and thereby acquire infectious organisms. This while they often did fare much better as suggested in the book (and the sources it tends to cite). They often did mount successful resistance, were quick to adapt to new military technologies, build sprawling citiest and much more.

"Check out, The Dawn of Everything. Goes a ways towards arguing against much of the determinism of Diamond, and does a better job of exploring the various ways early cultures developed and grew.","[3&&elmonoenano&& If you read the Dawn of Everything, read some criticism of it too. I like Graeber. I think he's good at setting up thought experiments, but he plays fast and loose with facts, much like Diamond. He makes a lot of errors and omits a lot of important counter examples, and misinterprets data that doesn't fit his hypothesis. This review in NYRoB is a good place to start: https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2021/12/16/david-graeber-digging-for-utopia/ ]"
"My approach to that: Go to the library. Look up Guns, Germs and Steel and go find it on the shelf. It will be surrounded by similar books. That is literally what I did for years, before work consumed all of my time. I'd find a book I liked, then go to the library and pick up a bunch of other books from the same section (or by the same author) that looked interesting.","[2&&AutoModerator&& Hi! It looks like you are talking about the book Guns, Germs, and Steel by Jared Diamond. The book over the past years has become rather popular, which is hardly surprising since it is a good and entertaining read. It has reached the point that for some people it has sort of reached the status of gospel. On r/history we noticed a trend where every time a question was asked that has even the slightest relation to the book a dozen or so people would jump in and recommend the book. Which in the context of history is a bit problematic and the reason this reply was written. Why it is problematic can be broken down into two reasons: In academic history there isn't such thing as one definitive authority or work on things. There are often others who research the same subjects and people that dive into work of others to build on it or to see if it indeed holds up. This being critical of your sources and not relying on one source is actually a very important skill in studying history often lacking when dozens of people just spam the same work over and over again as a definite guide and answer to ""everything"". There are a good amount of modern historians and anthropologists who are quite critical of Guns, Germs, and Steel and there are some very real issues with Diamond's work. These issues are often overlooked or not noticed by the people reading his book. Which is understandable, given the fact that for many it will be their first exposure to the subject. Considering the popularity of the book it is also the reason that we felt it was needed to create this response. In an ideal world, every time the book was posted in r/history, it would be accompanied by critical notes and other works covering the same subject. Lacking that a dozen other people would quickly respond and do the same. But simply put, that isn't always going to happen and as a result, we have created this response so people can be made aware of these things. Does this mean that the r/history mods hate the book or Diamond himself? No, if that was the case, we would simply instruct the bot to remove every mention of it. This is just an attempt to bring some balance to a conversation that in popular history had become a bit unbalanced. It should also be noted that being critical of someone's work isn't the same as outright dismissing it. Historians are always critical of any work they examine, that is part of their core skill set and key in doing good research. Below you'll find a list of other works covering much of the same subject. Further below you'll find an explanation of why many historians and anthropologists are critical of Diamonds work. Other works covering the same and similar subjects. Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest 1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus Last Days of the Inca Epidemics and Enslavement: Biological Catastrophe in the Native Southeast, 1492-1715 The Great Divergence Why the West Rules for Now Ecological Imperialism: The Biological Expansion of Europe, 900-1900 Criticism of Guns, Germs, and Steel Many historians and anthropologists believe Diamond plays fast and loose with history by generalizing highly complex topics to provide an ecological/geographical determinist view of human history. There is a reason historians avoid grand theories of human history: those ""just so stories"" don't adequately explain human history. It's true however that it is an entertaining introductory text that forces people to look at world history from a different vantage point. That being said, Diamond writes a rather oversimplified narrative that seemingly ignores the human element of history. Cherry-picked data while ignoring the complexity of issues In his chapter ""Lethal Gift of Livestock"" on the origin of human crowd infections he picks 5 pathogens that best support his idea of domestic origins. However, when diving into the genetic and historic data, only two pathogens (maybe influenza and most likely measles) could possibly have jumped to humans through domestication. The majority were already a part of the human disease load before the origin of agriculture, domestication, and sedentary population centers. This is an example of Diamond ignoring the evidence that didn't support his theory to explain conquest via disease spread to immunologically naive Native Americas. A similar case of cherry-picking history is seen when discussing the conquest of the Inca. Pizarro's military advantages lay in the Spaniards' steel swords and other weapons, steel armor, guns, and horses... Such imbalances of equipment were decisive in innumerable other confrontations of Europeans with Native Americans and other peoples. The sole Native Americans able to resist European conquest for many centuries were those tribes that reduced the military disparity by acquiring and mastering both guns and horses. This is a very broad generalization that effectively makes it false. Conquest was not a simple matter of conquering a people, raising a Spanish flag, and calling ""game over."" Conquest was a constant process of negotiation, accommodation, and rebellion played out through the ebbs and flows of power over the course of centuries. Some Yucatan Maya city-states maintained independence for two hundred years after contact, were ""conquered"", and then immediately rebelled again. The Pueblos along the Rio Grande revolted in 1680, dislodged the Spanish for a decade, and instigated unrest that threatened the survival of the entire northern edge of the empire for decades to come. Technological ""advantage"", in this case guns and steel, did not automatically equate to battlefield success in the face of resistance, rough terrain and vastly superior numbers.

These issues are often overlooked or not noticed by the people reading his book. Which is understandable, given the fact that for many it will be their first exposure to the subject. Considering the popularity of the book it is also the reason that we felt it was needed to create this response. In an ideal world, every time the book was posted in r/history, it would be accompanied by critical notes and other works covering the same subject. Lacking that a dozen other people would quickly respond and do the same. But simply put, that isn't always going to happen and as a result, we have created this response so people can be made aware of these things. Does this mean that the r/history mods hate the book or Diamond himself? No, if that was the case, we would simply instruct the bot to remove every mention of it. This is just an attempt to bring some balance to a conversation that in popular history had become a bit unbalanced. It should also be noted that being critical of someone's work isn't the same as outright dismissing it. Historians are always critical of any work they examine, that is part of their core skill set and key in doing good research. Below you'll find a list of other works covering much of the same subject. Further below you'll find an explanation of why many historians and anthropologists are critical of Diamonds work. Other works covering the same and similar subjects. Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest 1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus Last Days of the Inca Epidemics and Enslavement: Biological Catastrophe in the Native Southeast, 1492-1715 The Great Divergence Why the West Rules for Now Ecological Imperialism: The Biological Expansion of Europe, 900-1900 Criticism of Guns, Germs, and Steel Many historians and anthropologists believe Diamond plays fast and loose with history by generalizing highly complex topics to provide an ecological/geographical determinist view of human history. There is a reason historians avoid grand theories of human history: those ""just so stories"" don't adequately explain human history. It's true however that it is an entertaining introductory text that forces people to look at world history from a different vantage point. That being said, Diamond writes a rather oversimplified narrative that seemingly ignores the human element of history. Cherry-picked data while ignoring the complexity of issues In his chapter ""Lethal Gift of Livestock"" on the origin of human crowd infections he picks 5 pathogens that best support his idea of domestic origins. However, when diving into the genetic and historic data, only two pathogens (maybe influenza and most likely measles) could possibly have jumped to humans through domestication. The majority were already a part of the human disease load before the origin of agriculture, domestication, and sedentary population centers. This is an example of Diamond ignoring the evidence that didn't support his theory to explain conquest via disease spread to immunologically naive Native Americas. A similar case of cherry-picking history is seen when discussing the conquest of the Inca. Pizarro's military advantages lay in the Spaniards' steel swords and other weapons, steel armor, guns, and horses... Such imbalances of equipment were decisive in innumerable other confrontations of Europeans with Native Americans and other peoples. The sole Native Americans able to resist European conquest for many centuries were those tribes that reduced the military disparity by acquiring and mastering both guns and horses. This is a very broad generalization that effectively makes it false. Conquest was not a simple matter of conquering a people, raising a Spanish flag, and calling ""game over."" Conquest was a constant process of negotiation, accommodation, and rebellion played out through the ebbs and flows of power over the course of centuries. Some Yucatan Maya city-states maintained independence for two hundred years after contact, were ""conquered"", and then immediately rebelled again. The Pueblos along the Rio Grande revolted in 1680, dislodged the Spanish for a decade, and instigated unrest that threatened the survival of the entire northern edge of the empire for decades to come. Technological ""advantage"", in this case guns and steel, did not automatically equate to battlefield success in the face of resistance, rough terrain and vastly superior numbers. The story was far more nuanced, and conquest was never a cut and dry issue, which in the book is not really touched upon. In the book it seems to be case of the Inka being conquered when Pizarro says they were conquered. Uncritical examining of the historical record surrounding conquest Being critical of the sources you come across and being aware of their context, biases and agendas is a core skill of any historian. Pizarro, Cortez and other conquistadores were biased authors who wrote for the sole purpose of supporting/justifying their claim on the territory, riches and peoples they subdued. To do so they elaborated their own sufferings, bravery, and outstanding deeds, while minimizing the work of native allies, pure dumb luck, and good timing. If you only read their accounts you walk away thinking a handful of adventurers conquered an empire thanks to guns and steel and a smattering of germs. No historian in the last half century would be so naive to argue this generalized view of conquest, but European technological supremacy is one keystone to Diamond's thesis so he presents conquest at the hands of a handful of adventurers. The construction of the arguments for GG&S paints Native Americans specifically, and the colonized world in general, as categorically one step behind. To believe the narrative you need to view Native Americans as somehow naive, unable to understand Spanish motivations and desires, unable react to new weapons/military tactics, unwilling to accommodate to a changing political landscape, incapable of mounting resistance once conquered, too stupid to invent the key technological advances used against them, and doomed to die because they failed to build cities, domesticate animals and thereby acquire infectious organisms. This while they often did fare much better as suggested in the book (and the sources it tends to cite). They often did mount successful resistance, were quick to adapt to new military technologies, build sprawling citiest and much more. When viewed through this lens, we hope you can see why so many historians and anthropologists are livid that a popular writer is perpetuating a false interpretation of history while minimizing the agency of entire continents full of people.

The importance of agriculture specifically to disease is also far from agreed upon, even by actual historians and anthropologists. The ""guns"" part is also oversold, as matchlocks were less useful even than crossbows in the Americas, and cannons were in too short of supply (the Spanish struggled to maintain sufficient powder for cannons even in their 18th century forts,) to stop a determined enemy.

This is where you begin to enter the “leftist” perspective of the entry of the United States into the First World War. Once Russia was out of the war there was now a very threatening possibility that France and Britain could lose, and if they lost that would mean the massive investments that the United States had made into their side would be lost and was a massive financial push factor in bringing the United States into the war. In regards to the Flu, it was wartime, everyone was doing it.

"Why did land and resource-rich Africa not industrialize before comparatively land and resource-scarce Europe, even prior to the waves of European colonization in the late XIXth century?","[6&&GSilky&& Industrialization happened in a corner of Europe where the precise combination of capitalism, resources, science and technology, politics, religion, and everything else that goes into industrialization, appeared. It spread from Britain to the rest of Europe and then the rest of the world. If any of these factors were missing, it wouldn't have happened in Britain either. ]"
"Why did land and resource-rich Africa not industrialize before comparatively land and resource-scarce Europe, even prior to the waves of European colonization in the late XIXth century?","[2&&elmonoenano&& Industrialization isn't just about resources. It's about a whole host of institutions and cultural ideas. Those happened to be in England. You need a legal system and conception of property that prioritizes the property rights of ideas and the institutions to market, sell, and buy those. You need things like copyrights and patents. You also need institutions to allocate capital. That requires fairly complex banking, loans, and financial devices like stocks. Once again you need legal institutions like a limited corporation and strong contract enforcement and predictable interpretation. The common law system of the UK provided those. That allowed things like public ownership of limited liability corporations for amassing and allotting capital. You need sufficient political power and revenue to maintain those systems. That requires strong states. The weakness of the Spanish states and its institutions like banking and intellectual property rights, as well as monopolies that discouraged competition, also hindered Spain. You also need a level of specialization and population that only happens in certain types of urban areas. You need big cities with large populations and specialization. That requires more efficient farming to sustain. You need certain types of states, certain economic and legal institutions, and certain conceptions of property that didn't exist in the same way in Africa. You need types of agriculture and urbanization that didn't happen in Africa until the 20th century. A lot of those factors are self reinforcing. You get efficient agriculture and land becomes more valuable so you want established and clear contracting rules for selling and buying it. You also want enforceable contracts for selling excess grain. Then you start to want things like commodity futures to stabilize pricing and demand. Then you want insurance to protect your investments. You also want infrastructure to process and transport it. And then it's easier to buy land and farm it and sell your crop so it's more valuable to be an efficient farmer. So there's more grain. So there's more incentive to operate efficient milling or transportation. If you're not good at farming it's smarter to specialize in something you are good at so you can still make money to buy grain. So you get more specialization in your economy. You get industries to promote that specialization, like guilds and universities, to teach people more valuable skills, and so on and so on. ]"

I remember the Enola Gay was named after Paul Tibbets’ mother. Has she ever been interviewed or made a statement about it?,"[22&&zippotato&& The only reaction of Enolay Gay Tibbets on the bombing I'm aware of is the following part from a 2002 interview between Paul Tibbets and writer Studs Terkel: Studs Terkel: By the way, I forgot to say Enola Gay was originally called “Number 82.” How did your mother feel about having her name on it? Paul Tibbets: Well, I can only tell you what my dad said. My mother never changed her expression very much about anything, whether it was serious or light, but when she’d get tickled, her stomach would jiggle. My dad said to me that when the telephone in Miami rang, my mother was quiet first. Then, when it was announced on the radio, he said: “You should have seen the old gal’s belly jiggle on that one.” ]"
"In the early 2000s I got the autographs of Tibbets and Van Kirk at an air show. There were still a lot of WWII vets who were able to make an appearance at that show. They and the Warbirds were featured. The airshow sold Program with photos and articles of the featured guests, and we were encouraged to get as many autographs as we could. We got dozens and usually had wonderful talks with the vets. My son was about 8 or 10 at the time and was already a Warbird enthusiast, and the old vets loved talking to him. There were a few famous vets who charged $5 or something for their autograph, but most were free. They were all excited and happy, even as they looked tired and they all had a volunteer or two around them to manage any crowds and keep them from getting overwhelmed. Tibbets and Van Kirk were in a separate area. They charged something like $15 for Tibbets’ signature and $25 for both. There was a long line to get to see them. I thought maybe we would be able to exchange a few words as we got their autographs, but it was impossible. By the time we got there it was mid-afternoon and hot. Once you got to the head of the line you got about ten seconds to slide your program across the table to one, who signed it and passed to to the other as the next person in line was already handing his program over. They were both visibly hot and tired and miserable. They were so tired they weren’t talking to anyone. Once I saw them I was sorry to have bothered them. We still have their autographs and I sometimes think of my tiny encounter with both of them. There was a sense of something historic and important coming to an end that day.","[67&&Mr_Fahrenheit-451&& I had a similar conflicted reaction when getting an autograph from Buzz Aldrin.

"[295&&SerkTheJerk&&POST=The city with two downtowns - Dallas: the bi-nodal city] Oak Cliff began to develop in 1887, when Thomas Marsalis and John Armstrong purchased 2,000 acres of property and renaming Hord’s Ridge for the large oak trees and Austin Chalk hills in the area. To provide transportation from the City of Dallas to the City of Oak Cliff, Marsalis developed the first reliable transit service across the Trinity River. The right-of-way of that transit line was Jefferson Boulevard along which the steam train ran; then the electric streetcars and the interurban which ran to Fort Worth, and finally automobiles and buses. The City of Oak Cliff was annexed into Dallas in 1903. In the succeeding years from 1910 to 1935, West Jefferson Boulevard, originally platted for residential development, became the commercial, financial and social heart of Oak Cliff. Businessmen saw West Jefferson as an opportunity to locate along this busy transit line, providing professional services, retail goods, and other services to the surrounding neighborhoods which were developing during this time: Winnetka Heights, Miller Stemmons, King’s Highway, Ruthmede, Kessler Park, Lake Cliff and Trinity Heights. West Jefferson Boulevard developed as the Central Business District or Downtown for Oak Cliff. It was easily accessible to all the surrounding neighborhoods listed above because of the streetcar lines which ran down West Jefferson and turned north on Tyler branching east and west; south on Tyler into Ruthmede; south on Zang and continuing along West Jefferson to the Boundary district and linking to the interurban to Fort Worth. Dallas, during this time, became a bi-nodal city; a city with two central areas, one represented by Downtown Dallas and one represented by West Jefferson. Another period of growth along West Jefferson occurred during the years after World War II and continued into the early 1950s further confirming its position as the downtown for Oak Cliff. Several large retailers built new buildings along West Jefferson, Sears, JCPenney, and the first suburban Kress in Dallas, and other property owners refaced their 1920s buildings to accommodate the tastes of the prosperous post war consumer. This idea of a bi-nodal city, or at least the importance of West Jefferson as a substantial commercial center, was often acknowledged in the Dallas newspapers, articles in 1933, 1948, and 1965, describe this area as second only to Downtown Dallas in size and sales tax generation. West Jefferson stretches for 10 continuous blocks or 1 mile (1.6 km) in length. It is believed that no other city in Texas had this type of development of a “city within a city” and two downtown commercial districts. West Jefferson continues to be the downtown of Oak Cliff expressing the cohesive yet culturally diverse community which it serves. Jefferson Boulevard was originally platted as the right-of-way for the major thoroughfare through Oak Cliff, first for the steam line, then the streetcar and interurban, and finally the automobile. West Jefferson, although platted for residential development, became the center for commercial activity in Oak Cliff. The surrounding streets of Sunset, Center, and Twelfth developed as suburban residential streets for the working and middle class. The architectural styles in the West Jefferson Historic District reflect the urban commercial forms prevalent from 1910 to 1950. The majority of the commercial growth in this area occurred between 1920 and 1940. Because this was not a planned shopping center such as Highland Park Village - the first self-contained shopping center in America, the individual property owners constructed their commercial buildings as they would their homes, in styles they personally liked. This resulted in the construction of a variety of commercial styles. Many of these smaller scale commercial buildings are stylistically unique. West Jefferson contains a variety of urban commercial styles of which there is no other comparable collection in Dallas. The most prominent building along West Jefferson is the 1920s Art Deco style Jefferson Tower. It was the first high-rise constructed in Oak Cliff. Although many of the buildings have been altered, as noted above, several of these alterations occurred in the post War years. These alterations and the other later alterations that have occurred are mainly to the first floor retail area, exchanging weed fronts for aluminum and covering over transom windows. Architectural analysis indicates that these buildings can be restored with minimal work and guidance. West Jefferson Boulevard commercial development originally occurred at two nodes: between Beckley and Zang and between Polk and Tyler. The architecture in these areas reflect early urban commercial styles from 1910 to 1925. More common along West Jefferson is the one story commercial building which houses several retail spaces. One particular style of this genre is a tan brick one story with a mansard type roof and a pedimented entry and, usually, a corner entry with an arch and fan light. Transom windows are above the large single pane display windows. This style can be seen in four retail segments along West Jefferson. In the period from 1925 to 1935, West Jefferson Boulevard saw a great deal of commercial growth. Despite the Depression, this is the period during which most of the growth occurred on West Jefferson. Such buildings as the Texas Theatre and several other commercial buildings were constructed between 1925 and 1935. The Texas Theatre, now an historic landmark, was the largest suburban theater in Dallas. This Spanish Eclectic t​​heater was part of a chain of theaters once owned by Howard Hughes. In November of 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald was apprehended here after the Kennedy Assassination. It was one of multiple theaters along West Jefferson with the Rosewin Theatre (named after the adjacent neighborhoods of Rosemont and Winnetka Heights) between Polk and Tyler being demolished in 1976, later replaced with a modern one story commercial building.

This idea of a bi-nodal city, or at least the importance of West Jefferson as a substantial commercial center, was often acknowledged in the Dallas newspapers, articles in 1933, 1948, and 1965, describe this area as second only to Downtown Dallas in size and sales tax generation. West Jefferson stretches for 10 continuous blocks or 1 mile (1.6 km) in length. It is believed that no other city in Texas had this type of development of a “city within a city” and two downtown commercial districts. West Jefferson continues to be the downtown of Oak Cliff expressing the cohesive yet culturally diverse community which it serves. Jefferson Boulevard was originally platted as the right-of-way for the major thoroughfare through Oak Cliff, first for the steam line, then the streetcar and interurban, and finally the automobile. West Jefferson, although platted for residential development, became the center for commercial activity in Oak Cliff. The surrounding streets of Sunset, Center, and Twelfth developed as suburban residential streets for the working and middle class. The architectural styles in the West Jefferson Historic District reflect the urban commercial forms prevalent from 1910 to 1950. The majority of the commercial growth in this area occurred between 1920 and 1940. Because this was not a planned shopping center such as Highland Park Village - the first self-contained shopping center in America, the individual property owners constructed their commercial buildings as they would their homes, in styles they personally liked. This resulted in the construction of a variety of commercial styles. Many of these smaller scale commercial buildings are stylistically unique. West Jefferson contains a variety of urban commercial styles of which there is no other comparable collection in Dallas. The most prominent building along West Jefferson is the 1920s Art Deco style Jefferson Tower. It was the first high-rise constructed in Oak Cliff. Although many of the buildings have been altered, as noted above, several of these alterations occurred in the post War years. These alterations and the other later alterations that have occurred are mainly to the first floor retail area, exchanging weed fronts for aluminum and covering over transom windows. Architectural analysis indicates that these buildings can be restored with minimal work and guidance. West Jefferson Boulevard commercial development originally occurred at two nodes: between Beckley and Zang and between Polk and Tyler. The architecture in these areas reflect early urban commercial styles from 1910 to 1925. More common along West Jefferson is the one story commercial building which houses several retail spaces. One particular style of this genre is a tan brick one story with a mansard type roof and a pedimented entry and, usually, a corner entry with an arch and fan light. Transom windows are above the large single pane display windows. This style can be seen in four retail segments along West Jefferson. In the period from 1925 to 1935, West Jefferson Boulevard saw a great deal of commercial growth. Despite the Depression, this is the period during which most of the growth occurred on West Jefferson. Such buildings as the Texas Theatre and several other commercial buildings were constructed between 1925 and 1935. The Texas Theatre, now an historic landmark, was the largest suburban theater in Dallas. This Spanish Eclectic t​​heater was part of a chain of theaters once owned by Howard Hughes. In November of 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald was apprehended here after the Kennedy Assassination. It was one of multiple theaters along West Jefferson with the Rosewin Theatre (named after the adjacent neighborhoods of Rosemont and Winnetka Heights) between Polk and Tyler being demolished in 1976, later replaced with a modern one story commercial building.

"[295&&SerkTheJerk&&POST=The city with two downtowns - Dallas: the bi-nodal city] Oak Cliff began to develop in 1887, when Thomas Marsalis and John Armstrong purchased 2,000 acres of property and renaming Hord’s Ridge for the large oak trees and Austin Chalk hills in the area. To provide transportation from the City of Dallas to the City of Oak Cliff, Marsalis developed the first reliable transit service across the Trinity River. The right-of-way of that transit line was Jefferson Boulevard along which the steam train ran; then the electric streetcars and the interurban which ran to Fort Worth, and finally automobiles and buses. The City of Oak Cliff was annexed into Dallas in 1903. In the succeeding years from 1910 to 1935, West Jefferson Boulevard, originally platted for residential development, became the commercial, financial and social heart of Oak Cliff. Businessmen saw West Jefferson as an opportunity to locate along this busy transit line, providing professional services, retail goods, and other services to the surrounding neighborhoods which were developing during this time: Winnetka Heights, Miller Stemmons, King’s Highway, Ruthmede, Kessler Park, Lake Cliff and Trinity Heights. West Jefferson Boulevard developed as the Central Business District or Downtown for Oak Cliff. It was easily accessible to all the surrounding neighborhoods listed above because of the streetcar lines which ran down West Jefferson and turned north on Tyler branching east and west; south on Tyler into Ruthmede; south on Zang and continuing along West Jefferson to the Boundary district and linking to the interurban to Fort Worth. Dallas, during this time, became a bi-nodal city; a city with two central areas, one represented by Downtown Dallas and one represented by West Jefferson. Another period of growth along West Jefferson occurred during the years after World War II and continued into the early 1950s further confirming its position as the downtown for Oak Cliff.

It's long, but the subject is fascinating, I think. It is part of a bigger text I wrote about the Medieval Western Mediterranean. ------ The tombstone was set in late 12th century Norman Sicily. It’s of a woman, the mother of a noble priest. The Tombstone for Anna - Symbol of a Medieval Melting Pot/ Additional info from the Museum With No Frontiers: Inscription in Four Languages A few things are unusual about the tombstone. The most striking thing is that it contains writings in four distinct writing systems, and three languages. Latin to the left, Greek to the right, Arabic below, and Judeo-Arabic, or Arabic written in Hebrew characters, on top. (Around the time when this tombstone was created, 90% of the world’s Jews spoke a form of Judeo-Arabic as their first language. Nearly all major Jewish works of literature of the Middle Ages were written in some form of Arabic. Within a decade of the creation of the tombstone, the greatest of all Arabic Jewish philosopher-theologians, the great Maimonides, would start writing his first work.) That in itself makes it incredibly unique. A little background. The gravestone was created in Norman Sicily. The Normans are an interesting bunch. These were descendants of Vikings, whose ancestors had settled in Western France in the 10th century. In the 11th century, these French Vikings managed to conquer a whole bunch of territory, including England (where Norman rule led to the development of a distinct English language) and Moorish Sicily. It’s Sicily under these Normans that gave us the tombstone. Arriving in Sicily in the 1061, a time in which the Zirid emirate of Greater Tunisia, on which Sicily was semi-dependent, laid devastated as a result of massive Bedouin migrations, turning the extremely prosperous, highly centralized central North Africa into a land of lawless nomads, with Bedouin tribes leveling cities, vandalizing farming land and disrupting trade routes. With Sicily itself embroiled in an 8-year long civil war, the great Roger I of Sicily led the Normans into conquest. Central North Africa, as opposed to the less urbanized Morocco and the Libyan deserts, would always hold onto a pretty sophisticated urban tradition, in towns such as Tunis, Bejaija, Constantine, Sousse and Mahdia, but with the Bedouinization of the interior, Tunisia’s urban culture was for centuries restricted to a thin stretch of coast. Up until the 19th century, Tunisia’s internal political culture was defined by a clash between the towns and the nomads, high civilization and anarchy existing side by side. With central North Africa in chaos, Sicily became especially vulnerable to an outside attack. With the arrival of the Normans in Sicily, something interesting happened. Roger I turned out to be an arabophile. After having secured the island, the Normans went on to embrace the Arabic customs they encountered. From using Arabic political titles ('amiratus amiratorum'), to giving birth to an architectural style that was infused with Arabic elements, to appointing Muslims to senior political positions (Ibn Zafar al-Siqilli, Abu'l-Qasim ibn Hammud ibn al-Hajar), to attracting Arabic intellectuals from across the sea (Muhammad al-Idrisi, Abu al-Salt), even to using the Arabic language in a semi-official capacity. For nearly two centuries, Christian Sicily was governed as a Muslim emirate. Decades after this tombstone was set, a funerary memorial contained the following sentence, describing Sicily’s capital city, Palermo, the largest city in Europe at that point: 'urbs felix, populo dotata trilingua' Meaning: 'fortunate city, endowed with a trilingual people'. Stepping back, it shouldn’t be surprising to see these languages being used. Back to the tombstone. The different texts apparently differ significantly from each other. The Arabic text, for example, refers to the Pope as the ‘imam of Rome’. It refers to the church where the lady was initially buried as a ‘jami’, a word meaning assembly, but more commonly used to refer to a main mosque. The inscriptions refer to the death of Anna, mother of Grisanto, a priest of the Norman sovereign Ruggero (Roger), who died in 1148 and was buried in the great jami (subsequently Palermo Cathedral) and from there taken by her son to the Church of San Michele Arcangelo and the chapel known as Sant’Anna, built by Grisanto in 1149. Other tombstones consisting of Latin, Greek and Arabic writings have been found, but this is the only one that also includes a Hebrew inscription. These types of inscriptions had an obvious proselytizing goal. In other words, these types of inscriptions were made to help spread the word of Christ to Muslims and Jews (and Orthodox Greeks), not an attempt to declare Islam and Judaism as equals of Christianity. Others have suggested that the Arabic texts were directed at Muslim and Jewish converts to Christianity, and to Arabic-speaking native Sicilian Christians.

The inscriptions refer to the death of Anna, mother of Grisanto, a priest of the Norman sovereign Ruggero (Roger), who died in 1148 and was buried in the great jami (subsequently Palermo Cathedral) and from there taken by her son to the Church of San Michele Arcangelo and the chapel known as Sant’Anna, built by Grisanto in 1149. Other tombstones consisting of Latin, Greek and Arabic writings have been found, but this is the only one that also includes a Hebrew inscription. These types of inscriptions had an obvious proselytizing goal. In other words, these types of inscriptions were made to help spread the word of Christ to Muslims and Jews (and Orthodox Greeks), not an attempt to declare Islam and Judaism as equals of Christianity. Others have suggested that the Arabic texts were directed at Muslim and Jewish converts to Christianity, and to Arabic-speaking native Sicilian Christians.

Maybe in their egocentric view they could've convinced themselves they were doing the natives a favor, by making them more ""modern"", but at the end of the day the effects were to tear down the culture that these people had existed in and developed long before they were colonized, without giving them any option to say, ""no, we'd rather continue our own way of life"" ]"

[15&&David_Lo_Pan007&&POST=Did China Colonize Vietnam?],"[7&&Davebr0chill&& Colonization involves both conquest and settlement. Simply conquering a country and extracting tribute is not colonization, and when people move to another place as small groups emigrating or without wresting control from the indigenous population that isn't colonization either.

Then there were places where Chinese people settled, but that China did not conquer, like in Southeast Asia, and across the silk road.

[15&&David_Lo_Pan007&&POST=Did China Colonize Vietnam?],"[6&&Longjumping_Care989&& Well, lets start by conceding the obvious problems: The whole concept of national identity is complete bollocks vague and subjective to the point that identifying the national identity of a pre-modern ""state"" often dissolves into meaningless emotionally charged controversy. That is notoriously particularly true in an East Asian context, because the concept of nation states is a form of complete bollocks uniquely conceived of as applying to Early Modern Europe, and it's only Western conceitedness that seeks to apply it elsewhere has very little application to East Asian politics where the principles of state formation are more about a neutral civil bureaucracy and a government which may, from time to time, control that bureaucracy, than any underlying ethnic or linguistic identity. The boundary between simply conquest and colonisation is not, in itself, black and white. Having said that: The Qin dynasty- traditionally seen as the first dynasty to rule a unified Chinese state- was centred in the Huang He (Yellow River) Valley. In 221-214 BCE, it campaigned against the Yue people living south of the Yangzi (Yangtse) River Valley, roughly as far south as modern Northern Vietnam. Qin, for the most part, conquered them. The Yue were neither Chinese nor Vietnamese but spoke a language with connections to both modern Vietnamese and Cantonese. Qin collapsed in 206 BCE and was replaced by the Han Dynasty. Some areas of modern Northern Vietnam and Southern China were conquered by a renegade Qin general amidst the chaos, and formed the state of Nanyue, or, in Vietnamese, Nam Viet (so cognate with modern Vietnam). Nanyue was somewhat creolised having both Chinese and Yue aristocracy and cultural elements. Whether it could be considered a Vietnamese, Chinese, or a colonised state is a vague and subjective question. In 111 BCE, Han conquered Nanyue and had already subjugated any other Yue states. Han made substantial efforts to integrate Northern Vietnam into Chinese culture and induced the migration of many Chinese to Northern Vietnam. I would personally regard that as a clear colonial project. Han rule briefly collapsed between 40-43 CE in the face of a Vietnamese rebellion, but was relatively swiftly re-established, and this time lasted until 544 CE, albeit that Han was replaced in that time by both the Wu dynasty (one of the Three Kingdoms), the Jin dynasty, and a succession of regional southern dynasties. Apart from Jin, none of these ruled all or most of the core territories of modern China, so take your pick as to whether or not they count as such. Northern Vietnam was a more-or-less mainstream province of each of these dynasties, with an aristocracy and government that had very substantial Chinese roots, albeit a population that identified themselves as different. Chinese rule over Vietnam was again interrupted by a rebellion (among Vietnamese but lead by those of Chinese ancestry) in 544 CE and independence lasted until 602 CE, when it was reconquered by the Jin Dynasty. The next period of Chinese rule, primarily that of the Tang dynasty, lasted until 938 CE. Formally, the territories now forming modern Vietnam were part of the Tang ""Protectorate General to Pacify the South"", one of a number of military governments on frontiers of Tang. Northern Vietnam might in that period be thought of as being under Tang military occupation with a fairly thin veneer of Chinese or Siniticised aristocracy and an increasingly distinct and poorly assimilated general population with some, but relatively little, colonisation. During yet a further period of internal chaos in China, Northern Vietnam broke away again in 938 CE, this time, on a mostly permanent basis. This independence was broken only briefly, around 500 years later, when between 1407 CE and 1427 CE, the Ming dynasty was able to establish a fourth military protectorate over Northern Vietnam, before it was overthrown by rebellion. Akin to most states in East Asia, most Vietnamese dynasties paid tribute to China and were integrated into its trading system, but this is very far removed from colonisation. So my answer? Northern Vietnam spent most of its very early history as either a Chinese province or military protectorate with some, but relatively short lived and limited, colonisation, and very substantial administrative influence. This came to a permanent end a very long time ago. Southern Vietnam had no such influence. ]"

For example in discussions about fascism people generally talk about totalitarianism and racism, but there is less talk about how German and Italian capitalists funded brown and blackshirts to attack organized labor and how Hitler paid back industrialists with swathes of privatization. Colonization, capitalism, and the rise of western powers were intertwined in our history, but it's more convenient for liberals to reduce the meaning of colonization in our history in a way that can now be used to benefit themselves. I have no illusions that the Chinese are acting not out of benevolence, but in their own self interest.

The lighter skin of Europeans comes from Proto-Indo-Europeans, stark contrast to the Asiatic/Hunnic or Turkic groups that inhabit the steppes now, uh? So WHGs, EEFs, and Yamnaya, all mix and mash until some point in the Middle Bronze Age when Europeans had fully evolved into what they are now. Out of modern groups, Sardinians particularly, have the highest EEF percentages in their genetic makeup at a wopping 80%, at least. Hunter-Gatherers, think of blue eyes, cave paintings, and a hunting party chasing a mammoth down. EEFs, think of the Stone Age, sophisticated farming practice, and Otze the Iceman Yamnaya, the domestication of horses, the invention of the wagon, as well as advancement in metallurgy that actually started in the Middle/Late Neolithic Period or Copper Age. ]"

"""More plausibly, those who constructed the tombs were migrant workers from Anatolia who imitated the kind of work that they had produced in their home country. But could individual workers who had migrated to Etruria influence the design of the tombs of the elite class on a national level? This does not seem at all plausible."" While minor I think a contradiction like this is very odd. Why would you state a conclusion is probable, and then in the same paragraph conclude that it isn't plausible at all?

"I don’t think this author understands how big an impact trade can have. I’m not saying this theory is wrong, but everything they put forward can be done through trade. What explains the striking similarities between Etruscan graves and Anatolian graves? Is trade or general cultural influence really the best explanation for this? How could it be? Workers would have had to know what Anatolian tombs looked like. That they were Etruscans who had traveled to Anatolia and were taken on a tour of the tombs is surely not a viable explanation. Country A has nice building, country B does not. Because of this, country B hires an engineer from country A. We have plenty of records of this happening around the world. They also make it seem like the Etruscans and Greeks were equally as advanced, and equally open to foreign influence. The Etruscans were also being influenced by Greece at this point. Edit: I really just don’t agree with how they dismiss trade as opposed to presenting an alternative to it","[1&&Particular-Second-84&& I've heard a lot of arguments for and against this theory. The big issue really is whether trade is the most logical explanation for what we see. If your suggestion is correct, then why don't we similarly see Anatolian-inspired monumental tombs in other places that we know traded extensively with that region, like Greece in particular? For me, one of the most interesting and important parts of the article is this quote from Reynald Higgins: “The Oriental influences in Etruria are not of the same order as the contemporary Orientalizing phase in Greece. Although there are obvious resemblances, the process in Etruria was much more sudden in its inception, and far deeper-rooted in its effects.” As the article says, why would this be the case if trade was responsible for the Anatolian aspects of Etruscan culture? I think this reasoning (again, from the article) makes sense: The Greeks were geographically closer to Anatolia, and had been trading with and settling there for centuries by 700 BCE. Greece established numerous colonies there, with large groups of people going back and forth. Therefore, the fact that Eastern influences were so much stronger in Etruria than in Greece is definitely conspicuous. I'm not saying that it's impossible that trade is responsible for the things you mention. But I don't see how it could be said to be the most logical or natural explanation. ]"

Originally written in 1978 but the version I read was released in 2016. Fairly short book (240 or so pages) about the experiences of British soldiers from recruitment to the end of the war. Lots of personal accounts, some from the time some from after the war. Pretty well written and accessible, no prior knowledge needed imo. Overall would definitely recommend if you want a quick WWI read about the British experience. In terms of depth 'Tommy: The British Soldier on the Western Front 1914-1918 by Richard Holmes' is better but it is way longer and probably needs a bit more prior knowledge. Just finished up The Facemaker by Lindsey Fitzharris 4.75/5 Very enjoyable short (250 pages) book about WWI facial surgery and facial reconstruction. Specifically focuses on one important surgeon, Harold Gillies (from New Zealand, worked in Britain), so the book is biographical and easy to follow. You don't really need to know anything about WWI as the major events are given in fairly basic terms (the beginning of the battle of the Somme, the German Spring Offensive, Spanish flu etc) so you know the context of what is happening. The medical details are also well explained with plenty of gory details of the injuries which is nice. Lots of individual stories of soldiers who were maimed and how the surgery worked. Overall I would definitely recommend it if you want an easy to get into medical history book. (Fitzharris also wrote a book about Victorian medicine called The Butchering Art which I also really enjoyed and would reccomend) Edit - Is the automod triggered by ""victor"" in ""Victorian""? ]"

We want to give you all more chances to ask questions though so we'll keep an eye on this thread through the evening and tomorrow and will post responses whenever Claire, Nicole and Andrew are available. Thanks so much for having us! We hope our answers were helpful and we'd love to do this again sometime! - Angel We’re Washington Post reporters Nicole Dungca, Claire Healy and Andrew Ba Tran. We published a deep dive into Aleš Hrdlička, the founder and head curator of physical anthropology for the Smithsonian – and the man behind at least 19,000 of its collection of human remains. Hrdlička was long held in esteem by the organization, and was known as an authority on physical anthropology and the origins of mankind during his lifetime. But many are now revisiting his well-documented racist beliefs and ties to eugenics. Over a year and a half of reporting this story, we explored Hrdlička’s notoriety and how he used his status to influence U.S. government policies on race, built a network of body part procurers and distributed instructions on his methods for harvesting remains from hospitals and other places all over the world. We examined thousands of documents and interviewed dozens of Smithsonian officials, experts, descendants and members of affected communities to piece together one of the most extensive looks at his work and collections to date. Ask us anything.

"Thanks for joining us! I'm always interested in the ""why now"" aspect of reporting on academic history. What prompted your deep dive into Hrdlička, his methods, and the ongoing fight for repatriation of human remains and cultural material? Why now? In the field we learn about the ""original sin"" of physical anthropology both in undergrad and grad school. Your article mentions several academics whose work has focused on Hrdlička for years, as well as the decades of struggle by indigenous nations demanding repatriation. What prompted your investigation now, and what confluence of events brought the information together for publication?","[32&&washingtonpost&& From Nicole Dungca: Some of it is timing! Like Claire said, she started talking to Janna Añonuevo Langholz, an activist in St. Louis, after The Riverfront Times wrote about her work marking the graves of the Filipinos who came to St. Louis for the 1904 World's Fair and died there. My background as a Filipino American made me really interested in working on this as soon as I heard about the Filipino angle. And as more people heard about this story, more journalists in the room got involved -- and everyone was so invested in telling this story correctly. It's also an interesting time to be covering this because museums have been paying more attention to returning items that were taken in unethical ways -- such as many of the human remains that were taken during Hrdlicka's time. We found that only 4 brains in the collection had documents that showed the individuals or families involved had consented to their organs becoming museum property. To activists, this comes years and years after they first started pushing for repatriation of objects that are were stolen or taking in other unethical ways. But more anthropologists and activists are pushing this kind of news to the forefront, and some are even advocating for new laws that would require the remains of African Americans in museums to be repatriated. Right now, federal law only mandates that museums repatriate the human remains of Native American, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian communities. In most cases, the remains from other communities are left in limbo. ]"

This investigation started when I came across research from activist Janna Anonuevo Langholz in 2022 showing that four Indigenous Filipinos who died at the 1904 World’s Fair had their brains removed and brought to the Smithsonian. That prompted immediate questions about why and how this had happened, and the answer to both of those questions was Ales Hrdlicka. So Nicole, Andrew and I looked at the collection of human brains he started, and tried to answer the why. To do so we dove into his work, publications, personal correspondence, etc. Our research found that families likely didn’t know the remains were taken at the time. This all is happening now because of the chain of events generated by people like Langholz, who came across this in one way or another, and are trying to reconcile with this history that is largely forgotten. ]"
"Another question, if you don't mind... How do you balance the need to tell this story without scapegoating one man? Hrdlička didn't operate in a vacuum. He was surrounded by a scientific community hell bent on proving white supremacy by any means measurable. Hrdlička couldn't operate without the expressed support of the Smithsonian, and a cadre of wealthy donors. How do you balance retelling the horrible actions of one man with the necessity of providing the context of a larger eugenics/scientific racism movement surrounding his work?","[35&&washingtonpost&& From Nicole Dungca: Agree that context is important -- so we made sure to include that kind of context in every story. Eugenics and race science were both rampant at the time Hrdlicka was in charge of the Smithsonian's physical anthropology division, so we wanted to make clear that he was just one of many who were collected body parts and trading them left and right. And we also showed how he cultivated a network -- meaning there were people all over the world who were willing to send him remains. But Hrdlicka also stood out because he was so influential at the Smithsonian's U.S. National Museum, which was one of the most prominent museums in the world. To this day, the National Museum of Natural History, which followed the National Museum and still holds the remains, is one of the most visited museums globally. So we thought it was important to show how respected Hrdlicka was at the time, because his views -- which included believing that White people were superior -- could be interpreted as some sort of fact, or having some sort of scientific basis. Hrdlicka was just one of many prominent people who believed in eugenics and race science, and his opinions were printed in the newspaper and had ramifications for how the rest of the country viewed race. We also found he had access to people like Franklin Roosevelt and Theodore Roosevelt because of his perch at the Smithsonian -- so people at the highest levels of government were considering his views. ]"
"How closely were you able to study the inventory/lists? And if given the chance, was there anything that stuck out to you that you didn't get a chance to include in the story (and if not, anything else you didn't get a chance to talk about that would like to)?","[15&&washingtonpost&& From Andrew Ba Tran: Claire started out with a sparse spreadsheet of all the accession file numbers that the Smithsonian has related to brains and body parts collected since the 1800s. We set about gathering all the accession memos and letters tied to those file numbers because it often times provided much more information than in the spreadsheet, like who donated the parts and more details on where they came from. Many of the documents were already digitized by the Archives but many of we had to scan by hand via microfilm. After we had the PDFs, much of the text was in handwriting (files from the 1800s, right?) so we ran the documents through AI to pull out the text to see if we could detect any interesting patterns. A brilliant news engineer, Dylan Freedman who makes amazing tools to help journalists at the Post, also came up with a novel system to overlay the text on top of the images so I could parse through them quickly. In the end, we have thousands upon thousands of documents that we've ran through natural language processing and have extracted metadata from. There are many interesting individual stories within these files. I found one letter from a woman notifying the Smithsonian that her husband, who had donated many he had excavated from Native American burial grounds, had died while the mound he was poking around in collapsed on top of him. Unfortunately, we only have documents through 1958 as the Museum of Natural History declined to help us get any after that point in history. ]"

First, we got inventories of human remains from the National Museum of Natural History -- those would include information such as the location and year of when the human remains were collected, as well as an accession number. That ""accession number"" allowed us to look up files in the Smithsonian Institution Archives that gave us more information, including correspondence between Hrdlicka and whomever sent him the human remains. From those letters and documents, we could discern things like the demographics of the people whose remains were taken. All of this was helpful because we could get a bigger picture of the scope of the collection -- so we saw that human remains came from more than 80 countries, for example. By analyzing this kind of information, we were able to see which locations Hrdlicka had targeted, or the people who sent him many remains. We found, for example, that a doctor named Charles Firestone sent him several brains from Indigenous people, including the Sami woman who was a big part of our first story (gift link). A man named Robert Bennett Bean sent many human brains from the Philippines, while he was in charge of anatomy at a medical school in the Philippines. We could see there were many remains from Peru, for example, and also from various communities in Alaska. Once we saw this kind of information, we were able to dig deeper into the stories we wanted to tackle. ]"

"[60&&Arcmyst&&POST=Did Caesars portrayed themselves as saviors, such as doing miracles, aiding the weak, and fighting spiritual evils?] I'm asking if the Roman emperors had described themselves as good guys, protectors and spiritual heroes against evil, in any similar tone the Western Christian-like values we know.

I'm nothing asking about the obvious parallel story latter found in the Christian Gospel.

Thanks.","[64&&svarogteuse&& No. At least not how you are trying to depict things. Polytheistic religion doesn't have a good vs evil dichotomy that modern monotheistic religions do. There is no devil or Satan in polytheism. Now Augustus was the champion of order, stability and peace after generations of civil wars but that wasn't some religious war. Nearly 50 years later Vespasian is tied to miracles but the Empire is changing. Emperors are becoming more and more monarchs, and eastern monarchs than restorers and promoters of the Republic. People are also superstitious and uneducated, a ruler like Vespasian isnt going to try and deny such things happen if the ignorant masses want to believe them, as far as he is concerned the ignorant tying him to the gods only means they are less likely to rebel. I think you need to reread the passage on Vespasian. He didn't do miracles, he tried to avoid the situation, passed it off to doctors and only then reluctantly allowed the common folk to touch him feigning a smile. Like a star allowing some fan to shake his hand. The common folk then claim a miracle happened and Vespasian was willing to accept the gods worked though him but he didnt then run off and go cure people all over the empire. The Emperors were no more claiming the power of doing miracles than Pope Francis claims he does them. Should someone come up and touch them then declare themselves healed he may nod and smile and attribute such acts to God but that is a far cry from purposefully making an act of performing miracles. ]"

Thanks.","[12&&Squatchy_One&& You may be reading Tacitus too authoritatively. As with modern sources, its important to critically view ancient sources. Accounts of miracles are literary tools. Remember Tacitus was a politician with his own ambitions and goals. His career started under Vespasian, and Vespasian had just overthrown someone, creating a new dynasty separate from that of the first Roman emperors after another period of civil war and multiple political killings following Nero's death. It is also important to remember that most of society at this time was illiterate. Tacitus was part of the small upper class that could read, and he is writing for the wealthy and educated, not the masses. It is also helpful to keep this in mind when reading the gospels historically. The gospels are from roughly the same time period as Tacitus (closer to 70-80 for Matthew, Mark, and Luke, and closer to 90/95 for John). Stories of miracles were oral stories circulating at the time. Tacitus was organizing, or inventing, these miracle accounts for his audience to consider. Tacitus' History was written after the end of the Flavian dynasty, and it is obvious from his reading that he was no fan of the last Flavian ruler, Domitian. So attributing divine miracles to the founder of the dynasty and not the last Flavian ruler makes the narrative of the rise and fall of the dynasty nice and tidy. In his mind, the Flavians had clearly lost their divine authority. This would be something the current emperor, Trajan, would look favorably on, as he was part of the dynasty that replaced the Flavians. Tacitus did very well career wise under this new dynasty, and they were reading his works. To legitimize their power Caesar and Augustus claimed and consolidated many ceremonial titles and consolidated them in one person. One being Pontifex Maximus, which the Christian bishops of Rome/popes would also adopt in later centuries. The title appeals to a sense of divine authority and legitimacy in the emperor, and set himself apart as the political and religious head of Rome. It's important to remember Christianity was not a major force in the Roman world until roughly the late third century. Historically speaking, Greek and Roman culture had a much larger impact on early Christianity than Christianity on the early Roman empire, if it had a meaningful impact at all. For some of the earliest examples of the good and evil dichotomy you may want to read about Zoroastrianism and its influence on both Judaism and by extension Christian thought. ]"

The very earliest talks about Jesus don't call him the ""Son of God,"" and he doesn't call himself that anywhere in the Bible. The closest he comes is calling himself the ""Son of Man,"" which is distinctly different! However, Rome had a ""Son of God"" precedent in one of the emperors! In fact, it was the first and most important one, Caesar Augustus! You see, when Julius Caesar was murdered, a comet appeared in the sky. Caesar's faction were able to successfully run a spin campaign that said he had been accepted by Rome's gods into their pantheon, an apotheosis. They even got the Senate to officially declare this to be true (it wasn't the first time the Roman Senate had declared a person to be a god posthumously; they had done it previously for Alexander the Great). Now, if Caesar was a god, what did that make his adopted son, Octavian? In Latin, he started referring to himself as 'Divus Filius,' or 'son of a god.' This happened before Jesus was born. Thus, by creating the dogma that Jesus was, in fact, the living son of a coupling between God and the Virgin Mary, western Christians were arguing that Jesus, and by inheritance the Church as well, were on the same level of authority as the emperors. ]"

"[60&&Arcmyst&&POST=Did Caesars portrayed themselves as saviors, such as doing miracles, aiding the weak, and fighting spiritual evils?] I'm asking if the Roman emperors had described themselves as good guys, protectors and spiritual heroes against evil, in any similar tone the Western Christian-like values we know. For example, on Histories, 4.81, the historian Tacitus talks about Vespasian doing miracles and curing the blind. I'm nothing asking about the obvious parallel story latter found in the Christian Gospel. Vespasian itself seemed to repulse the common people, and the miracles supposedly happened just because Gods chosen the emperor to bring luck. Did Roman emperors claimed to be saving the weak and beating evil forces is any somewhat way the Good vs Evil tales we have? Even if under specific cases. It's known Romans sacrificed the life of gladiators to appeased dead spirits, but it sounds a small issue if compared with a spiritual warfare.

Culture, politics, economics, government, and religion were fundamentally intertwined - but not in the same way that something like the medieval Church was politically powerful. It wasn't really centralized - it was just a part of the world that they lived in. Roman politicians and leaders were supposed to observe certain rites and rituals to ensure that their endeavors would be successful (militarily, economic, politically, etc). The gods were fickle parts of nature - they couldn't care less about your soul, they were more interested in what you could do for them. Satisfy them and they might be willing to influence things on your behalf. Have a bad harvest? Well there's prescribed festivals and sacrifices to make so that Saturn might help you out more next year. Going to war? Well there's some specific rites to observe so that Mars is satisfied and will grant you a good campaigning season. Traveling by sea to trade some goods? A small sacrifice at a local temple to Neptune might go a long way to ensuring you won't run into any nasty storms. So to the Romans, someone like Augustus wasn't granted superpowers or whatever because the Gods liked him, but part of his success was due to the Gods - and how pious he was with making sure they were always satisfied.

[286&&Particular-Second-84&&POST=When and Why Did Roman Britain End?],"[37&&PDV87&& The interesting part of this story is that Roman Britain (or in this case, sub-Roman Britain) didn't really end, it just transformed. First, in the late 4th century, Magnus Maximus (known to the Britons/Welsh as Macsen Wledig), withdrew many of the legions from Britain in his personal bid for imperial power. He also took with him many administrators, governors and other Romano-British members of the ruling class. He was eventually defeated by Theodosius. At this point, raids on the lightly-defended island by the Saxons, Picts and Scoti all increased in intensity. The general Stilicho allegedly ordered a campaign to refortify Britain and end the seaborne threat, but his plans were interrupted by Gothic incursions; consequently even more troops were withdrawn from Britain. Shortly thereafter Constantine III took command of the remaining British legions and led them to the continent in order to defend the Empire against the Germanic invasions. With Saxon raids reaching a fever pitch, the Romano-British entreated Emperor Honorius for assistance in ~409-410; his response was that they look to their own defenses, and the Romano-British aristocracy expelled the remaining imperial administrators. At this point, Britain as a polity fractured into petty kingdoms on old tribal lines: Bryneich, Dumnonia, Dyfed, Rheged, Gwynedd, etc. The Anglo-Saxon raids had become migratory, resulting in general warfare between them and the Britons; about ~44 years following the initial Anglo-Saxon settlement, the Battle of Badon was fought. This was a decisive victory for the Britons, stalling the Anglo-Saxon expansion for an entire generation, and is the genesis for the legend of King Arthur. The Britons did not capitalize on this victory, but rather fell into civil war and infighting, resulting in the success of the next wave of Anglo-Saxon invasions. There is debate on whether the Anglo-Saxons displaced the Britons wholesale or just supplanted the ruling class; either way, there is a lot of genetic evidence pointing to the two groups fusing together, particularly in Southeastern England. The Romano-British and Anglo-Saxons formed a new culture, with many of the formers' administrative apparati surviving, likely due in part to the gradual Christianization of the Germanic settlers. The British polities that survived (or the surviving British ruling class that had been supplanted) were pushed back to Wales, Cornwall and northwestern England. A few generations later, you have the heptarchy of Christian Anglo-Saxon kingdoms reliving the struggle of their vanquished foe against the Pagan Vikings. ]"

The fact is that at the time Rome was beset by the Visigoths and had no troops to spare (never mind that the isle was regularly deserted by the Roman military in the past so this wasn't even something new) and whether Honorius explicitly told Britain as much or not doesn't really change that the outcome for Britain was already more or less sealed. ]"

The fact is that at the time Rome was beset by the Visigoths and had no troops to spare (never mind that the isle was regularly deserted by the Roman military in the past so this wasn't even something new) and whether Honorius explicitly told Britain as much or not doesn't really change that the outcome for Britain was already more or less sealed.","[20&&Particular-Second-84&& It's definitely an interesting subject! Thank you for the detailed comment. There is certainly a lot involved in this 'rabbit hole', as you put it. This is my professional area of expertise, so here are my thoughts on the matter: In my opinion, the letter being sent to Britain is impossible for a few key reasons. But first, let's consider the two possible meanings of the letter: Honorius was letting the Britons know that, in the event of them being attacked, the Romans would not be able to defend them. Honorius was simply informing them that he would be withdrawing the Roman troops from the island, so from now on, the Britons would have to take care of their own defense. I don't think that either of those scenarios are possible in the context of Britain in 410. Consider the first scenario: The context of Zosimus' passage in which Honorius' letter is sent is Alaric's attacks on northern Italy. In the years leading up to 410, he had gone down as far south as Rome itself, and in 410 he was still active in north Italy and still showing an interest in Rome. In this passage, we find the statement that Honorius sent that letter to 'Britain'. Now, does this really make sense? The context of the passage is explicitly Alaric's attacks. Was Britain under any threat from Alaric? No, it was not. Throughout this whole period, Alaric was focused on northern Italy and in moving south towards Rome. Therefore, I do not believe that scenario 1 is remotely plausible. Now, scenario 2: The primary issue with this is that, as Zosimus himself explains, the Britons had already expelled the Roman administration in 409, the year before this letter by Honorius was sent. Therefore, Honorius no longer had any hold on the island by 410. Any troops that remained there had become independent, and thus Honorius could not have withdrawn them even if he had wanted to. But also, by 410, most if not all of the Roman troops had already been withdrawn by Magnus Maximus (in 383 and 387) and Constantine III (in 407). Therefore, the idea that Honorius was withdrawing troops from Britain to help with the fight against Alaric in northern Italy makes no sense, because there were virtually no troops left there to withdraw - certainly not enough that it would be worth mentioning. On the other hand, let's suppose that it's a reference to Bruttium in southern Italy. Now, the idea that Honorius would withdraw troops from that region to go and assist in the fight against Alaric in northern Italy makes perfect sense. Bruttium was close enough that troops could conveniently be taken from there, but far enough away that it wasn't in any immediate danger from Alaric's attacks. Crucially (and this is what I think most commentators about this subject are unaware of), there are other examples of ancient texts referring to 'Britain' where the context makes it abundantly clear that they mean 'Bruttium', so much so that there is no controversy surrounding these other references. Therefore, the idea that Zosimus' reference to 'Britain' here could have been a mistake for 'Bruttium' is not just a nice idea, but it actually has several demonstrable precedents. Also, it's not at all the case that Gildas definitely refers to the same letter described by Honorius. He does mention that at the end of Roman Britain the Romans refused to come back to help them, but surely this would match what Zosimus wrote about the background to the Britons expelling the Roman administration in 409. He specifically says that they did so because the Romans were not helping them against barbarian raids. I believe that this synchronism makes more sense than connecting Gildas' words with Honorius' letter. ]"
"Oh wow, to think this subject would be something I run into in the wild. For reference, I'm a lawyer (academic) not a historian, but I do have a love for history and as I was writing a paper on early Anglo-Saxon settlements and their influence on the development of Common Law (for further reference, I'm from a Civil/Roman Law country so Common Law is a seldom discussed and quasi-exotic topic), I came upon the letter discussion as I was writing up the intro to my paper dealing with the end of Roman rule in Britain. I went down the rabbit hole and overall I think there's very little room for doubt in regards to the authenticity of the letter. To begin with there's nothing overtly problematic with it beyond the observation of ""Kinda weird he'd write to Britain no?"", but it's no less strange he'd write to Bruttium (in fact the geographical proximity is an argument against rather than for it being the intended recipient, considering there were a number of more effective channels to delegate and go through like say the provincial governor rather than sending a direct letter to them, which would on the other hand make sense for Britain). Though what actually sealed the deal for me while I was writing and what made me leave it in the paper in the end was the fact that Gildas in his own writings on the history of Britain explicitly mentions a letter with more or less the exact meaning as described by Zosimu. This is at the very least confirmation that Britain did receive a letter from a Roman emperor saying ""Go ahead and fend for yourselves."" or in the base case scenario if you take it at face values, serves as independent confirmation of Zosimus's account.

Following his statement about Brittia, he says that, after paying his troops with money sent by Heraclianus, Honorius felt secure, having won the support of armies everywhere. The proposition that Brittia is Bruttium has never been convincingly rejected, even though Matthews himself from it. 155 151 - Zosimus 6.10.2 152 - Matthews (1975), p. 320, n. 7. see also Bartholomew (1982). 153 - Olympiodorus, fr. 16. 154 - Bleckmann (1997), pp. 572-5, suggests that the error stems from Zosimus' (or his source's) confusion of Bolonia in Italy with Boulogne in northern Gaul (both called Bononia by the Romans). Woolf, A. (2003), pp. 346-7, leaves the issue open. 155 - In the 1990 reprint (p. 403), Matthews retracted the idea in face of objections raised by E. A. Thompson (19777). However, the weight of Thompson's riposte lay more in vehemence than argument. As a side note regarding the geographical proximity, it should be noted that Constantine III's bid for the purple had claimed much of the western half of the WRE with Gaul, Hispania and Britannia, nominally at least, were under his control. Similarly, Honorius had not too recently executed his competent right hand, Stilicho, and had had difficulty retaining the loyalty of his officials and finding competent people to run the empire. Attempting to address such an area so far from control and with Alaric marauding within Italy at the time makes some sense. Gildas and his work is something that deserves a post all of his own; he is a particularly difficult source to grapple with. First and foremost, the raison d'etre for De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae is one of religion, not history, Gildas writing his work as a scolding admonition to the lack of (perceived) piety in his own age with the third being most obvious in its reproach. Gildas is significant for being the only writer from the 6th C in sub Roman Britain, a brief flicker of light in an otherwise dark era, lending his work a great deal of otherwise undue focus. There is mention of a letter sent to Rome but the reply is not one of helplessness: Picts and Scots. De duabus gentibus vastatricibus. 14. After this, Britain is robbed of all her armed soldiery, of her military supplies, of her rulers, cruel though they were, and of her vigorous youth who followed the footsteps of the above-mentioned tyrant and never returned. Completely ignorant of the practice of war, she is, for the first time, open to be trampled upon by two foreign tribes of extreme cruelty, the Scots from the north-west, the Picts from the north; and for many years continues stunned and groaning. 21 Defence made against them. De defen sione. 15. Owing to the inroads of these tribes and the consequent dreadful prostration, Britain sends an embassy with letters to Rome, entreating in tearful appeals an armed force to avenge her, and vowing submission on her part to the Roman power, uninterrupted and with all strength of heart, if the enemy were driven away. A legion 22 is forthwith prepared, with no remembrance of past evil, and fully equipped. Having crossed over the sea in ships to Britain, it came into close engagement with the oppressive enemies; it killed a great number of them and drove all over the borders, and freed the humiliated inhabitants from so fierce a violence and threatening bondage. The inhabitants were commanded to build a wall across the island, between the two seas, so that, when strongly manned, it might be a terror to repel the enemies and a protection to the citizens. The wall being made not |35 of stone but of turf,23 proved of no advantage to the rabble in their folly, and destitute of a leader. Notably the details are rather garbled and the only other mention of letters is that to ""Agitius"", the figure commonly thought of as Aetius. ]"

"The interesting part of this story is that Roman Britain (or in this case, sub-Roman Britain) didn't really end, it just transformed. First, in the late 4th century, Magnus Maximus (known to the Britons/Welsh as Macsen Wledig), withdrew many of the legions from Britain in his personal bid for imperial power. He also took with him many administrators, governors and other Romano-British members of the ruling class. He was eventually defeated by Theodosius. At this point, raids on the lightly-defended island by the Saxons, Picts and Scoti all increased in intensity. The general Stilicho allegedly ordered a campaign to refortify Britain and end the seaborne threat, but his plans were interrupted by Gothic incursions; consequently even more troops were withdrawn from Britain. Shortly thereafter Constantine III took command of the remaining British legions and led them to the continent in order to defend the Empire against the Germanic invasions. With Saxon raids reaching a fever pitch, the Romano-British entreated Emperor Honorius for assistance in ~409-410; his response was that they look to their own defenses, and the Romano-British aristocracy expelled the remaining imperial administrators. At this point, Britain as a polity fractured into petty kingdoms on old tribal lines: Bryneich, Dumnonia, Dyfed, Rheged, Gwynedd, etc. The Anglo-Saxon raids had become migratory, resulting in general warfare between them and the Britons; about ~44 years following the initial Anglo-Saxon settlement, the Battle of Badon was fought. This was a decisive victory for the Britons, stalling the Anglo-Saxon expansion for an entire generation, and is the genesis for the legend of King Arthur. The Britons did not capitalize on this victory, but rather fell into civil war and infighting, resulting in the success of the next wave of Anglo-Saxon invasions.

If you want to act locally, you can ally with indigenous communities in their existing battles to repatriate material from your nearby museums. Even the most politically liberal places in the country, like Boston, have museums dragging their feet on repatriation issues. Second, Hrdlicka didn't operate in a vacuum. Though he was prolific and driven, he could not have amassed such an extensive collection of remains at the flagship American museum without the financial and political support of those who desperately wanted to prove the validity of white supremacy. Though there were detractors in the scientific community at the time, Hrdlicka was not an evil outlier operating in a bubble of racism. I wish the article focused less on Hrdlicka specifically, and more on the larger eugenics/scientific racism movement that celebrated his work. You can't really understand his career without understanding that larger scientific culture, nor can you see how we are still fighting the talking points of scientific racism if you scapegoat one man. ]"

Stumble into an enemy group while scouting, or looking for food, or other materiel, or livestock or the like, and typically a ""skirmish"" will ensue. Unlike a battle, where combatants on both sides are aware of the enemy presence in the area, and plan the attack or defense, and has time to set up. So the skirmishes are normally described as groups of as few as 2-6 fighters coming upon a group of almost any size. The weapons are diverse in these encounters, depending on the original purpose of the group: scouting groups may well be armed for battle already, but foraging groups might be carrying farming type implements along with sidearms. Archers could be involved in a skirmish, but again, like all skirmishers, only based upon what they were originally attempting to accomplish, and what they were carrying at the time. If they were out hunting small (or large) game to provide for a larger force, they might well be armed with theirs bows/arrows. ]"

Why would the gold wire have eroded?,"[16&&PoBoyPoBoyPoBoy&& I don’t think it did, chemically. I found that part confusing as well. If I understood the article correctly, the gold wire itself was removed—either after the jaw healed or after the man died and someone pulled the gold out for themselves. The evidence of the wire is based on hardened plaque buildup around where the wire was located and a filing of the teeth to make room for the knot. Everything else is guess work. The wire could have been copper or tin or whatever else, but the researchers believe that it would have left chemical deposits that would be detectable on the teeth as those other metals oxidize easily. Gold doesn’t oxidize (rust), though, so they guess it was made of gold. Pure gold is not strong enough, so they guess it was made with an alloy. They think a low amount of silver because of the earlier point of no oxidation evidence left on the teeth. The line where they say there’s no evidence left because it was buried a long time, I believe refers to trace deposits from the gold rubbing on the teeth and leaving tiny amounts of gold due to wear. These tiny amounts wouldn’t have chemically been worn away, but they could have PHYSICALLY eroded. And, again, we’re talking tiny trace amounts from the gold rubbing on the teeth, not staining due to chemical reactions. So, if the skull was exposed to wind, rain, dust, microbes, grit, etc. the tiny bits of gold could be physically worn off the teeth the same way they would have originally been deposited. ]"

"[183&&marketrent&&POST=Crania deformation reveals that the Hirota people of Japan intentionally flattened the back of their infants’ skulls, about 1,800 years ago]","[23&&marketrent&& Cranial modification is a form of body alteration where the head of a person is pressed or bound, usually at an early age, to permanently deform the skull.1 The practice predates written history, and researchers theorize that it was performed to signify group affiliation or demonstrate social status. “One location in Japan that has long been associated with cranial deformation is the Hirota site on the Japanese island of Tanegashima, in Kagoshima Prefecture. “This is a large-scale burial site of the Hirota people who lived there during the end of the Yayoi Period, around the 3rd century CE, to the Kofun Period, between the 5th and 7th century CE.” explains Noriko Seguchi of Kyushu University's Faculty of Social and Cultural Studies who led the study. [...] “Our results revealed distinct cranial morphology and significant statistical variability between the Hirota individuals with the Kyushu Island Jomon and Doigahama Yayoi samples,” continues Seguchi. “The presence of a flattened back of the skull characterized by changes in the occipital bone, along with depressions in parts of the skull that connects the bones together, specifically the sagittal and lambdoidal sutures, strongly suggested intentional cranial modification.” Noriko Seguchi et al.:2 [Tiesler, 2014] argues that ICM could have been performed daily by female caretakers and mothers on their infant kin; indicating this practice was an aspect of vertical social learning from generation to generation and old to young. 1 “Unveiling Japan's ancient practice of cranial modification: The case of the Hirota people in Tanegashima”, https://www.kyushu-u.ac.jp/en/researches/view/267 2 Seguchi N, Loftus JF III, Yonemoto S, Murphy MM (2023) Investigating intentional cranial modification: A hybridized two-dimensional/three-dimensional study of the Hirota site, Tanegashima, Japan.

Violence, Warlords, Aḳıncıs and the Early Ottomans (1300–1450)* Corpus Draculianum:the Corpus Draculianum brings together all sources from and about Vlad III Draculea (The Impaler, 1431-1476) from the period of 1448 to 1650: private, diplomatic and business correspondence, minutes of negotiations, administrative documents, narrative and pictoral sources, as well as inscriptions, coins and seals. Dozens of chroniclers, writers, and those in power from the ruling courts of the Safavid Empire to the Iberian Peninsula, Britain, and the Grand Duchy of Moscow have left relevant testimonies. The sources, written in 17 languages, have been critically edited and extensively commented upon by an interdisciplinary team of researchers. Accompanying studies preface each volume to facilitate the understanding and contextualization of the documents. The Metamorphoses of Power. Violence, Warlords, Aḳıncıs and the Early Ottomans (1300–1450): Controversial scholarly debates around the beginnings of the Ottoman Empire in the last century are not only rooted in the scarcity or heterogeneity of sources, but also in the mentalities and ideologies that canonised thought paradigms. This book uses an interdisciplinary approach at the interface between Ottoman, Byzantine, Mediterranean and Southeast European studies. Unusual sources such as Western Anatolian numismatics and predominantly European documents met innovative methods from the study of violence and power networks. Making a case study around the military aḳıncı institution, the author re-evaluates the emergence of the Ottoman polity in dealing with various warlords and across multiple identities and political affiliations. Dr. Adrian also have a youtube channel called ""Corpus Draculianum"" In Romanian (But with english subtitles) Where he talks about Vlad, The ottoman empire and other subject from the 15th century. ]"

As a reminder, r/history also has a recommended list of things to read, listen to or watch","[4&&elmonoenano&& I'm reading the Friedrich Katz biography of Pancho Villa. I'm breaking it up into chunks b/c it's pretty big, and I'm generally not afraid to tackle a big book. I just finished the first of 4 parts. It goes from the beginning of Villa's life until his prison escape in 1913. The first thing I'd say is this probably should have been two volumes. If you are thinking about it, I'd definitely try to find an ebook version. My paperback probably weighs about 8ish pounds. It's literally hard to hold if you're reading the beginning or the end b/c the weight distribution of pages make it hard to balance. My copy has fairly large pages with small type, so each page is like reading two or three pages. It's kind of demoralizing b/c the book with notes is about 1000 pages, so reading like 20 or 30 pages a day doesn't really feel like you're making any progress. But otherwise, the size is an attribute. Villa's early life is hard to document and Katz is upfront about that. He frames the book in the context of 3 legends about Villa, the Black, the White, and the Epic. The Black legend is about viewing Villa as a bandit and murderer, the view of the upper classes and military in Mexico. The White is the Robin Hood legend that gets told by people with more worker oriented perspective, and the Epic is the legend that Villa propagated. Katz does a good job of showing how documentary evidence, or the lack thereof supports or opposes various legends. I don't know a lot about the Mexican Revolution and you don't have to read this. Although it's focused on the North, Katz gives you sufficient background and context to have a good idea of what's going. Sometimes it's a little annoying b/c Villa isn't that important in the 1910-1911 phase of the revolution, so most of the info is context for Villa's rise. But it is helpful and this book is kind of a 2 for 1. You learn a lot about Villa and the Revolution at the same time. Katz also does a good job portraying Madero in realistic terms. He's easy to lionize b/c of his assassination, but he had a lot of significant faults and a lot of significant obstacles that hindered his ability and willingness to make important changes. Katz also does a good job with the notes. They're very much worth reading. I would say part 1 is a good text for an introduction to the early part of the Revolution. I'm going to take a break and read a couple other things before I tackle part 2. But I would say, this might be a good book for you if you had time to break it up and read it in sections. I think you'd have to be a researcher or grad student to make it worth reading in one go b/c I imagine the time commitment would be huge. I normally knock out about 250 to 300 pages of serious history reading in a week. This took me two weeks to read the first 200ish pages. ]"

"[79&&Original-SEN&&POST=Question on Civilization] Hey y’all, I had a quick question. If modern human beings were believed to originate from Africa, particularly eastern* Africa why is it that we see the first civilization in the Middle East (Mesopotamia). Why didn’t civilization start around the area that modern human beings developed? Ethiopia has a great deal of natural resources and water from the Nile and Red Sea. Also the only other group of humans were several thousand miles away in Asia (Neanderthals/ Denisovans). Also didn’t modern humans spend several thousand years in Africa before leaving? I just thought it would make sense to assume that civilization would have started around Ethiopia and then gradually moved outwards to the rest of the world. Especially considering that Early Africa was very tropical and teaming with life. The Sahara wasn’t a desert and there were massive sources of fresh watr like Mega Lake Chad. I assumed that the same evolutionary pressures that resulted in the formation of modern humans should have technically resulted in the formation of civilization right? Like a bunch of smart humans in proximity to one another + fresh water + minimal competition + ample food = first civilization? Like even if modern human beings made it out of Africa before civilization was a thing wouldn’t civilization eventually start where people started farming first and stopped being nomadic? Wouldn’t that location be Africa, again because of the vast amounts of farming land, vast rivers bodies in the east, north, and west.

While some very rich environments can get close with hunting gathering and fishing alone, to really cross the line needs agriculture. To make agriculture work, you need good candidate wild plants to domesticate, and the climate to grow them. The natural ancestors of the most productive food plants and domestic animals were to be found in the Fertile Crescent region of the Middle East, and that’s where the first agricultural cultures developed. ]"
"[79&&Original-SEN&&POST=Question on Civilization] Hey y’all, I had a quick question. If modern human beings were believed to originate from Africa, particularly eastern* Africa why is it that we see the first civilization in the Middle East (Mesopotamia). Why didn’t civilization start around the area that modern human beings developed? Ethiopia has a great deal of natural resources and water from the Nile and Red Sea. Also the only other group of humans were several thousand miles away in Asia (Neanderthals/ Denisovans). Also didn’t modern humans spend several thousand years in Africa before leaving? I just thought it would make sense to assume that civilization would have started around Ethiopia and then gradually moved outwards to the rest of the world. Especially considering that Early Africa was very tropical and teaming with life. The Sahara wasn’t a desert and there were massive sources of fresh watr like Mega Lake Chad. I assumed that the same evolutionary pressures that resulted in the formation of modern humans should have technically resulted in the formation of civilization right? Like a bunch of smart humans in proximity to one another + fresh water + minimal competition + ample food = first civilization? Like even if modern human beings made it out of Africa before civilization was a thing wouldn’t civilization eventually start where people started farming first and stopped being nomadic?

My 2 cents as a farmer and someone who likes hunting and less so gathering. I think most people underestimate the leap from collecting food as you need it to farming where you don’t see rewards for months or years into the future. Farming has a very different risk profile to hunter gathering I think humans are not the best at rationally evaluating risk and reward, we tend to do these calculations much more emotionally. Typically we undervalue rewards that are further in the future. We also need to feel quite secure if we are going to take on long term investments. In order for farming to make sense it needs to provide more return than hunting and gathering. This will never happen when resources are plentiful. When resources are scarce then you don’t have the security to invest long term. Your family is hungry today. Who knows if they will even be alive in 6 months when the grain is ready to harvest, they probably won’t be if you divert too much effort from getting food today. If I had more time and a proper keyboard I’d go into more detail. But hopefully this is enough to make my point. ]"

This happens in large arid regions crossed by a large river. Outside of that river valley, there's little chance of survival. Inside the valley the water of the river and the numerous sunny days allow the crops to grow quickly. So, you can have a lot of people living in one place, but little chance for them to leave.

So people settled in river valleys that have annual floods, which provide water and nutrients.

Competing vegetation makes agriculture more difficult, not less. Same for the disease this invites and the rough growing conditions (acidic/washed out soils, shattering heads, hostile plant roots, disease, space restrictions, flooding, unusually-high heat/humidity, shallow soils, certain clay soils, etc.). Further, the abundance of alternatives would discourage the development of civilization. It still did emerge, but it didn't reach the same heights as China or Persia for a variety of reasons. Finally, natural resources don't mean much in low-population economies. They're nice for handicrafts and export, but in a pre-industrial economy, they don't have a large role. There were some cases of states there taking advantage of this to develop their home countries (Musa dumping gold on MENA in exchange for architectural/scientific insights, Swahili exporting gold and Jade out to India for the same), but generally, they're naturally quite inflated.

And so you kind of need a good reason to start doing it. In this case, it all just comes down to the fact that Mesopotamia had very fertile and farmable land. If you don’t have extremely fertile land, there just isn’t that big of an incentive to independently develop agriculture, because farming is hard, backbreaking work, especially if you’re the first because you don’t have beasts of burden or effective tools until AFTER civilization has started somewhere already. Also, you point out that Africa was rich in resources. But metals aren’t really useful until after you already have civilization, and abundant flora and fauna just means it’s easier to hunt and gather rather than farm. Basically being the first to start farming is a huge investment, and food has to be scarce enough and farming lucrative enough for groups of humans to start doing it. ]"

What I’m claiming is that this agricultural development started in Africa and simply moved eastward due to widespread drought. Consider the wild Egyptian grain that was sold to Rome and transported throughout Europe. Consider the widespread sell of cocoa bean and sugar cane from Western Africa. Consider the massive jungles that still occupy central and Western Africa today. Also consider that trade routes that were established by the kingdom of Kush connecting Europe to India in the East of Africa. The Fertile Crescent not only extended out of Africa it was a part of a larger network of vegetation that later turned into desert. Even the Middle East suffered from the Desertification. People just tend to focus more on the ME then on African civilization. I feel that’s mainly because people say nothing happens in Africa but that doesn’t seem logical. Humans developed in Eastern Africa (Ethiopia), we hunted extensively around the area then eventually pitched early civilization near the start of the Nile. When that civilization took off we then spread out across the entirety of Sub Saharan Africa due to resources and eventually made our way down the Nile into the Middle East (while some Africans travelled into the ME through the horn (Yemen)).

Pre-dynastic Egypt was not agricultural but instead was a herding culture. There are solid arguments that the earliest cities in Egypt were cities of the dead where nomadic people buried their ancestors over hundreds or thousands of years. Early priests controlled those centers and eventually extended that control along the Nile. Climatic change encouraged the previously nomadic people to settle down and farm the Nile Valley. ]

It's the complete inability to put the listener into the shoes of the people he's talking about. Take the part where he makes jokes about the Aztecs thinking the cannons might be sentient. Jokes, pointless jokes any teenager could make. What I want from a historian is context and perspective.

"what gets me is there must have been books describing the library itself in perfect detail. and they kept them at the library, with the rest of the books.","[5&&MeatballDom&& There was a catalogue called the Pinakes which would have listed many of the books included in the library that was 120 books (a book contains about 700 lines, not to be confused with our modern use of the word. For example the Iliad is 24 books long, but today we publish it as just one with 24 chapters. In older books we call those chapters books, and those smaller bits within them chapters -- or the individual lines.). It wasn't every book listed, but it was every book known to Callimachus and the library strived to collect as many of them as possible. If you came into Alexandria with a book they didn't have yet, they would copy the book to make sure they did have one. There was no sort of copyright or publishing fees back then, this was the standard way people got new copies of things back then. The total number of books the library held varies heavily depending on the source, so it's hard to say. But also don't fall too deep in the trap of thinking that the library's destruction destroyed so many books that are now lost because of the library's destruction -- that's a myth. By the time the library finally collapsed, it was no longer the hot spot of academic popularity it once was, and most of the books there had already been moved to other places. And as I stated before, copying books was very common. If your friend had a book you wanted, you would just pay a scribe to make a copy for you, and there were cheaper or more expensive versions. Some would just reuse old paper to save money, and with modern tech we sometimes find old books that way because we can detect the older ink. And there were also a lot of libraries, including several massive private collections. Dr. Gainsford does a far better job than me going into all of this though, highly recommended read. http://kiwihellenist.blogspot.com/2015/12/library-of-alexandria-loss.html ]"

"[0&&ObadiahTheEmperor&&POST=Why Alexander the great, was not so great.] TITLE CHANGE: WHY ALEXANDER WAS NOT THE GREATEST, HANNIBAL SURPASSES HIM (I'll be mostly literal in the replies as is the German way. If any aggressive vibes come about, it's not intended whatsoever) For one, the quality of his victories speak volumes. First let us consider Issus, If we ignore the convenient dying of Memnon rendering the Persian fleet kinda useless at just the perfect time and consider the battle of Issus as an example. Then we can see that the ""brilliance"" of Alexander is obviously romanticized and blown out of proportion. First, once the common Myth of Dariuses Foolishness is overcome by interjecting that Darius was of the correct Persuasion that the Macedonian Army was split, his moves towards issus make sense. As he most likely intended to defeat by detail. However, it was only because of a convenient Storm that his position was made known to Alexander, thus ruining the plan. (source:Murison, C. L. “Darius III and the Battle of Issus.” Historia: Zeitschrift Für Alte Geschichte, vol. 21, no. 3, 1972, pp. 399–423. JSTOR, http://www.jstor.org/stable/4435274. Accessed 9 Aug. 2023.) And forcing Darius to retreat into Issus, and fight on unfavorable terrain, since by chance, they were a few hours late, and Macedon had united as a force. Thus that was the only option. Luck was on Alexanders side. It would take a good general to capitalize on the luck of course, however this advantage saved his neck. Thus, he cannot be called the greatest or unbelievably talented.As he did not produce an ingenius solution, but merely speeded to Parmenion. He exploited his luck in the most unoriginal matter. Not to forget of course that many of the accounts are heavily propagandized (Nicholas G. L. Hammond. “Alexander’s Charge at the Battle of Issus in 333 B.C.” Historia: Zeitschrift Für Alte Geschichte, vol. 41, no. 4, 1992, pp. 395–406. JSTOR, http://www.jstor.org/stable/4436258. Accessed 9 Aug. 2023) And of course here much can be criticized on Darius as well, such as Darius not making use of his advantages he had at hand at Issus. Seeing that the macedonian center was advancing, and that he was the chased price so to speak and would have been pursued, and that Parmenion was kept busy by his cavalry, the obvious move here would have been to retreat while barraging the macedons with archers. Tiring them out. And so, essentially split up the macedon army. Seeing that the macedon center has still not engaged with the enemy, not even Alexander would have been suicidal enough to charge with his cavalry alone. As response, Alexander would concentrate on the Persian cavalry, and here would have been the best time to close in, and surround the macedon army. Winning the day. But Darius not doing this does not diminish Alexanders capabilities as a general. Next Gaugamela. As Beloch himself argues in the ""Griechische Geschichte"", during Gaugamela Alexander left his position as commander in chief, to pursue the made opening in the persian army. This is of course in line with the reality of Alexander being reckless and young. A greatest of all time type, unbelievably talente general would not pursue a local victory, since it is known that that leads to disaster without calculating the risks of it first. But Alexander due to being young and impulsive would of course recklessly charge at the local opening in the persian center. The idea that this was somehow Voluntary and according to a strategic machination by Alexander is hard to believe. For one, it seems more that this was an impulsive decision. Especially considering that Parmenions messengers did not reach Alexander. (Source: Devine, A. M. “Grand Tactics at Gaugamela.” Phoenix, vol. 29, no. 4, 1975, pp. 374–85. JSTOR, https://doi.org/10.2307/1087282. Accessed 9 Aug. 2023.) Meaning, this was not part of the plan. Or else, the messengers would have known to seek him elsewhere. Meaning, this was great risky adapting to the present circumstance, rather than pre meditated strategems. This debacle being enabled of course, by darius once more not using his advantages correctly. Had he burned the two routes at the start, and forced Alexander to enter deeper into Persia, starving him out, he would have won. Making use of the enemies blunders and luck is what a good general does, and doing that whilst adapting to current battlefield changes is also nothing short of good, but to be in the greatest of all time, that is nowhere near enough. Contrast this with the Battles of Hannibal. Where the Fabian strategy was the only plausible way the romans could have won against Hannibal. The blunders that were made by the Romans, such as not expecting Hannibal to cross the alps, or expecting to win at Cannae, were not as critical as these by Darius. Hannibal passing the Alps for example is something that no one could or should have expected since it is a suicidal idea, it was not merely difficult, it was crazy. Morover, the suicidality is even increased when you have a potentially disloyal army of mercenaries. And at Cannae, the Romans correctly guessed that the Carthaginian center was the weakest point. So that Hannibal himself came to the center for Moral boost. Hannibal making it that far shows that he produced victories that in Quality, not result alone, but in quality and ingenuity, far outmatch anything Alexander ever did. Furthermore, it is premediated strategy and cunning that is at play most of the time with Hannibal. Not live battlefield adaptation as with Alexander. The plans hannibal developed working most of the time, prove an inherent grasp at how the battlefield will develop, thus not needing to even adapt. Further more, Hannibal has a better grasp at psychology than Alexander. As can be seen by his treatment of of the non latin italic prisoners, his use of Roman pride in baiting and more. Psychological warfare is as important to a general as literal warfare. Now, it can be argued, but he achieved all his goals! Surely that justifies being called THE greatest and unbelievably talented. However, that is simplistic. Consider his grand strategic conditions: mediocre king for a Persian Emperor ruling a declining empire as a rival, a great army left to you by your father, and Egyptians which hate Persia more than they hate you. And of course ancient supply possibilities which rendered the manpower pool of 1 million the persians had effectively useless. Grand Strategically speaking, all the stars align for your victory. Under those conditions you cannot lose as long as you are decent and good which Alexander was. Thus, this accomplishment is blown out of proportion. Contrast this with Hannibals Situation. Hannibal faced the Romans. They would send legion after legion due to sheer relentlessness and will power alone, risking to essentially suicide their own nation just to defeat Hannibal which was unheard of at that time. Alexander, had no such relentless and irrational enemies to fight. Even if Persia was big and vast, it was no Rome, it did not posses Romes grit and determination. At home, the senate of Carthage wont supply you with ships or armies or anything you need. So You are on your own. And in the meantime you win, Spain is being conquered by romans and there is nothing you can do cause you are not omnipresent. And the longer you fight, the longer your tactics might be learned by the enemy. Since not even Hannibal could be ingenius forever. Being 20 Years undefeated in the Roman Backyard under those conditions so to speak, solidifies the greatness Hannibal had. His defeat of course is unsurprising. It was impossible for him to win from a grand strategic standpoint.But making it that far, shows the Brilliance needed to actually be at least candidate to be called the greatest of all time and unbelievably talented. To actually be the greatest of all time, more is needed of course. So not even Hannibal would be the greatest. Now, here it can be argued, but Hannibal whom you say is so great, admired Alexander! Thus, Alexander has to be deserving of higher esteem. Not really. Now, although it is murky and the origins cannot be reliably determined, it is reported that hannibal said, that were it not for his final defeat, that he himself would have been the greatest general and because he lost it remains to be Alexander. We can see that Hannibal thought in terms of results alone and not quality of results. It does not matter if Alexander as a general was not as good as himself, Alexander still never was officially defeated and could claim to have conquered the known world. Thus, Hannibal thought he too would need to at least hold the tittle of never being defeated and his obvious superior qualities as a general would guarannty his place at the top. Thus, Alexander really does not deserve higher esteem because of Hannibals supposed admiration. The reason he, Alexander, was admired, is a rather superficial one. He never lost(but of course is not alone in having done this so it is also not that special), but could also claim to have conquered the known world. This combination, is the winning combination for good propaganda. Being the only man who conquered the world at only 30 years of age is mesmerizing enough to ignore your shortcomings. And of course as a King Personality, he does not come close to Cyrus. As he was detested by his asian subjects, and his arrogance was known to all corners of the world. Thus, Alexander is to be placed lower on the ladder than the likes of Hannibal for General, and the likes of Cyrus for King and Leader. He is talented, but among many talented greats.","[1&&MeatballDom&& It has not crossed this point yet, but a general reminder to everyone to please keep in mind that there is a human behind each username.

This in itself is quite oversimplified, so this will be the focus of this answer. Alexander wasn't 'lucky' because his enemies didn't drive home their advantages, at least this is and cannot be the main factor. Darius (and his advisors and satraps) did the best he could according to their ability, they were not just '80% in the game.' They too, had excellent troops (e.g. Greek mercenaries, cavalry) and able leaders. It is just that the Macedonians (and to a large part Alexander!) were just better and knew how to take advantage of certain situations better. They too, can be criticized for various things, as can be every warlord and king. Alexander was, however, quite good at assessing certain situations and transforming it beforehand or on the go to his own advantage. This happened at Gaugamela as well as in Issos, but also at the Granicus, Aornos or at the Hydaspes. He correctly guessed(or rather: knew) that the Persian cavalry will leave a gap by following his decoy manouever, thus exposing the weak point of their army: Dareios. He also correctly assessed that the Great King will flee when exposed to a certain amount of risk. More often then not, his victories had a battleplan he stuck to and thus achieved victory. Was faced with a impossible dilemma at Gaugamela: pursue the fleeing King or come to the rescue of Parmenion's badly mauled left wing? As we know, his decision was the correct one, but once again this is not a result of luck, but of him calculating pros and cons in mid-battle. I could go on, bit this should suffice to explain my stance. Furthermore, your essay ignores that Alexander was not some kind of anomaly luck-wise. Livy himself said ""To a good general, luck is important"", and thus, all great victories can be simplified by attributing them to luck and ignoring all the other factors that lead to said victories. By assuming that every leader has some sort of luck during his campaigns, they can be crossed out out of the equation completely, leaving the other factors. You mentioned Hannibal achieved his victories with more ""quality"" and against more odds? Yet he too, can be seen as having had a lot of luck. The Romans could've discovered or guessed his route trough the Alps a lot sooner, rendering the effect of surprise useless. His centre could've broken a lot sooner at Cannae, and his stratagem at the Campanian Fields could've worked either way. However, it is obvious that all these successes are mainly the results of his brilliance as a general, just as Alexander's exploits are. Both were seen as 'Great', even during their own lifetime, and neither was called particularly lucky. Edit: some spelling mistakes ]"

Then we can see that the ""brilliance"" of Alexander is obviously romanticized and blown out of proportion. First, once the common Myth of Dariuses Foolishness is overcome by interjecting that Darius was of the correct Persuasion that the Macedonian Army was split, his moves towards issus make sense. As he most likely intended to defeat by detail. However, it was only because of a convenient Storm that his position was made known to Alexander, thus ruining the plan. (source:Murison, C.

And forcing Darius to retreat into Issus, and fight on unfavorable terrain, since by chance, they were a few hours late, and Macedon had united as a force. Thus that was the only option. Luck was on Alexanders side. It would take a good general to capitalize on the luck of course, however this advantage saved his neck. Thus, he cannot be called the greatest or unbelievably talented.As he did not produce an ingenius solution, but merely speeded to Parmenion. He exploited his luck in the most unoriginal matter. Not to forget of course that many of the accounts are heavily propagandized (Nicholas G. L. Hammond. “Alexander’s Charge at the Battle of Issus in 333 B.C.” Historia: Zeitschrift Für Alte Geschichte, vol. 41, no. 4, 1992, pp. 395–406. JSTOR, http://www.jstor.org/stable/4436258. Accessed 9 Aug. 2023) And of course here much can be criticized on Darius as well, such as Darius not making use of his advantages he had at hand at Issus. Seeing that the macedonian center was advancing, and that he was the chased price so to speak and would have been pursued, and that Parmenion was kept busy by his cavalry, the obvious move here would have been to retreat while barraging the macedons with archers. Tiring them out. And so, essentially split up the macedon army. Seeing that the macedon center has still not engaged with the enemy, not even Alexander would have been suicidal enough to charge with his cavalry alone. As response, Alexander would concentrate on the Persian cavalry, and here would have been the best time to close in, and surround the macedon army. Winning the day. But Darius not doing this does not diminish Alexanders capabilities as a general. Next Gaugamela. As Beloch himself argues in the ""Griechische Geschichte"", during Gaugamela Alexander left his position as commander in chief, to pursue the made opening in the persian army. This is of course in line with the reality of Alexander being reckless and young. A greatest of all time type, unbelievably talente general would not pursue a local victory, since it is known that that leads to disaster without calculating the risks of it first. But Alexander due to being young and impulsive would of course recklessly charge at the local opening in the persian center. The idea that this was somehow Voluntary and according to a strategic machination by Alexander is hard to believe. For one, it seems more that this was an impulsive decision. Especially considering that Parmenions messengers did not reach Alexander. (Source: Devine, A. M. “Grand Tactics at Gaugamela.” Phoenix, vol. 29, no. 4, 1975, pp. 374–85.

Meaning, this was great risky adapting to the present circumstance, rather than pre meditated strategems. This debacle being enabled of course, by darius once more not using his advantages correctly. Had he burned the two routes at the start, and forced Alexander to enter deeper into Persia, starving him out, he would have won. Making use of the enemies blunders and luck is what a good general does, and doing that whilst adapting to current battlefield changes is also nothing short of good, but to be in the greatest of all time, that is nowhere near enough. Contrast this with the Battles of Hannibal. Where the Fabian strategy was the only plausible way the romans could have won against Hannibal. The blunders that were made by the Romans, such as not expecting Hannibal to cross the alps, or expecting to win at Cannae, were not as critical as these by Darius. Hannibal passing the Alps for example is something that no one could or should have expected since it is a suicidal idea, it was not merely difficult, it was crazy. Morover, the suicidality is even increased when you have a potentially disloyal army of mercenaries. And at Cannae, the Romans correctly guessed that the Carthaginian center was the weakest point. So that Hannibal himself came to the center for Moral boost. Hannibal making it that far shows that he produced victories that in Quality, not result alone, but in quality and ingenuity, far outmatch anything Alexander ever did. Furthermore, it is premediated strategy and cunning that is at play most of the time with Hannibal. Not live battlefield adaptation as with Alexander. The plans hannibal developed working most of the time, prove an inherent grasp at how the battlefield will develop, thus not needing to even adapt. Further more, Hannibal has a better grasp at psychology than Alexander. As can be seen by his treatment of of the non latin italic prisoners, his use of Roman pride in baiting and more. Psychological warfare is as important to a general as literal warfare. Now, it can be argued, but he achieved all his goals! Surely that justifies being called THE greatest and unbelievably talented. However, that is simplistic. Consider his grand strategic conditions: mediocre king for a Persian Emperor ruling a declining empire as a rival, a great army left to you by your father, and Egyptians which hate Persia more than they hate you. And of course ancient supply possibilities which rendered the manpower pool of 1 million the persians had effectively useless. Grand Strategically speaking, all the stars align for your victory. Under those conditions you cannot lose as long as you are decent and good which Alexander was. Thus, this accomplishment is blown out of proportion. Contrast this with Hannibals Situation. Hannibal faced the Romans. They would send legion after legion due to sheer relentlessness and will power alone, risking to essentially suicide their own nation just to defeat Hannibal which was unheard of at that time. Alexander, had no such relentless and irrational enemies to fight. Even if Persia was big and vast, it was no Rome, it did not posses Romes grit and determination. At home, the senate of Carthage wont supply you with ships or armies or anything you need. So You are on your own. And in the meantime you win, Spain is being conquered by romans and there is nothing you can do cause you are not omnipresent. And the longer you fight, the longer your tactics might be learned by the enemy. Since not even Hannibal could be ingenius forever. Being 20 Years undefeated in the Roman Backyard under those conditions so to speak, solidifies the greatness Hannibal had. His defeat of course is unsurprising. It was impossible for him to win from a grand strategic standpoint.But making it that far, shows the Brilliance needed to actually be at least candidate to be called the greatest of all time and unbelievably talented. To actually be the greatest of all time, more is needed of course. So not even Hannibal would be the greatest. Now, here it can be argued, but Hannibal whom you say is so great, admired Alexander! Thus, Alexander has to be deserving of higher esteem. Not really. Now, although it is murky and the origins cannot be reliably determined, it is reported that hannibal said, that were it not for his final defeat, that he himself would have been the greatest general and because he lost it remains to be Alexander. We can see that Hannibal thought in terms of results alone and not quality of results. It does not matter if Alexander as a general was not as good as himself, Alexander still never was officially defeated and could claim to have conquered the known world. Thus, Hannibal thought he too would need to at least hold the tittle of never being defeated and his obvious superior qualities as a general would guarannty his place at the top. Thus, Alexander really does not deserve higher esteem because of Hannibals supposed admiration. The reason he, Alexander, was admired, is a rather superficial one. He never lost(but of course is not alone in having done this so it is also not that special), but could also claim to have conquered the known world. This combination, is the winning combination for good propaganda. Being the only man who conquered the world at only 30 years of age is mesmerizing enough to ignore your shortcomings. And of course as a King Personality, he does not come close to Cyrus. As he was detested by his asian subjects, and his arrogance was known to all corners of the world.

As Beloch himself argues in the ""Griechische Geschichte"", during Gaugamela Alexander left his position as commander in chief, to pursue the made opening in the persian army. This is of course in line with the reality of Alexander being reckless and young. A greatest of all time type, unbelievably talente general would not pursue a local victory, since it is known that that leads to disaster without calculating the risks of it first. But Alexander due to being young and impulsive would of course recklessly charge at the local opening in the persian center. The idea that this was somehow Voluntary and according to a strategic machination by Alexander is hard to believe. For one, it seems more that this was an impulsive decision. Especially considering that Parmenions messengers did not reach Alexander. (Source: Devine, A. M. “Grand Tactics at Gaugamela.” Phoenix, vol. 29, no. 4, 1975, pp. 374–85.

Meaning, this was great risky adapting to the present circumstance, rather than pre meditated strategems. This debacle being enabled of course, by darius once more not using his advantages correctly. Had he burned the two routes at the start, and forced Alexander to enter deeper into Persia, starving him out, he would have won. Making use of the enemies blunders and luck is what a good general does, and doing that whilst adapting to current battlefield changes is also nothing short of good, but to be in the greatest of all time, that is nowhere near enough. Contrast this with the Battles of Hannibal. Where the Fabian strategy was the only plausible way the romans could have won against Hannibal. The blunders that were made by the Romans, such as not expecting Hannibal to cross the alps, or expecting to win at Cannae, were not as critical as these by Darius. Hannibal passing the Alps for example is something that no one could or should have expected since it is a suicidal idea, it was not merely difficult, it was crazy. Morover, the suicidality is even increased when you have a potentially disloyal army of mercenaries. And at Cannae, the Romans correctly guessed that the Carthaginian center was the weakest point. So that Hannibal himself came to the center for Moral boost. Hannibal making it that far shows that he produced victories that in Quality, not result alone, but in quality and ingenuity, far outmatch anything Alexander ever did. Furthermore, it is premediated strategy and cunning that is at play most of the time with Hannibal. Not live battlefield adaptation as with Alexander. The plans hannibal developed working most of the time, prove an inherent grasp at how the battlefield will develop, thus not needing to even adapt. Further more, Hannibal has a better grasp at psychology than Alexander. As can be seen by his treatment of of the non latin italic prisoners, his use of Roman pride in baiting and more. Psychological warfare is as important to a general as literal warfare. Now, it can be argued, but he achieved all his goals! Surely that justifies being called THE greatest and unbelievably talented. However, that is simplistic. Consider his grand strategic conditions: mediocre king for a Persian Emperor ruling a declining empire as a rival, a great army left to you by your father, and Egyptians which hate Persia more than they hate you. And of course ancient supply possibilities which rendered the manpower pool of 1 million the persians had effectively useless. Grand Strategically speaking, all the stars align for your victory. Under those conditions you cannot lose as long as you are decent and good which Alexander was. Thus, this accomplishment is blown out of proportion. Contrast this with Hannibals Situation. Hannibal faced the Romans. They would send legion after legion due to sheer relentlessness and will power alone, risking to essentially suicide their own nation just to defeat Hannibal which was unheard of at that time. Alexander, had no such relentless and irrational enemies to fight. Even if Persia was big and vast, it was no Rome, it did not posses Romes grit and determination. At home, the senate of Carthage wont supply you with ships or armies or anything you need. So You are on your own. And in the meantime you win, Spain is being conquered by romans and there is nothing you can do cause you are not omnipresent. And the longer you fight, the longer your tactics might be learned by the enemy. Since not even Hannibal could be ingenius forever. Being 20 Years undefeated in the Roman Backyard under those conditions so to speak, solidifies the greatness Hannibal had. His defeat of course is unsurprising. It was impossible for him to win from a grand strategic standpoint.But making it that far, shows the Brilliance needed to actually be at least candidate to be called the greatest of all time and unbelievably talented. To actually be the greatest of all time, more is needed of course. So not even Hannibal would be the greatest. Now, here it can be argued, but Hannibal whom you say is so great, admired Alexander! Thus, Alexander has to be deserving of higher esteem. Not really. Now, although it is murky and the origins cannot be reliably determined, it is reported that hannibal said, that were it not for his final defeat, that he himself would have been the greatest general and because he lost it remains to be Alexander. We can see that Hannibal thought in terms of results alone and not quality of results. It does not matter if Alexander as a general was not as good as himself, Alexander still never was officially defeated and could claim to have conquered the known world. Thus, Hannibal thought he too would need to at least hold the tittle of never being defeated and his obvious superior qualities as a general would guarannty his place at the top. Thus, Alexander really does not deserve higher esteem because of Hannibals supposed admiration. The reason he, Alexander, was admired, is a rather superficial one. He never lost(but of course is not alone in having done this so it is also not that special), but could also claim to have conquered the known world. This combination, is the winning combination for good propaganda. Being the only man who conquered the world at only 30 years of age is mesmerizing enough to ignore your shortcomings. And of course as a King Personality, he does not come close to Cyrus. As he was detested by his asian subjects, and his arrogance was known to all corners of the world. Thus, Alexander is to be placed lower on the ladder than the likes of Hannibal for General, and the likes of Cyrus for King and Leader. He is talented, but among many talented greats.","[33&&FireflyExotica&& Most of your points basically boil down to criticizing Alexander for the same things you praise Hannibal for, more or less. Both were unbelievable generals in their own right who took advantage of weaker leadership on the opposing sides. Undoubtedly, some or even most of what Hannibal knew came from tales of Alexander's conquests and strategic deployments in the first place seeing as he lived 100 years prior and was immensely famous, and he studied his tactics greatly and used them to great effect. Sure, plenty can be attributed to luck, but you criticize Alexander for making foolish and/or crazy decisions while simultaneously praising Hannibal for invading through the Alps, an idea you yourself admit to be basically suicidal. That it worked out is your proof that Hannibal was superior, yet Alexander making suicidal or improbable maneuvers simply makes him lucky? Come on now. On top of that, you paint a picture that Rome is some unbeatable force strategically which is not the case. Rome was unbeatable numerically, which, again, you did point out yourself, but your points seem to not understand what that means. Rome did not have dozens of supreme generals in which Hannibal defeated soundly. He mostly engaged incompetents or average leaders, compounded by the infighting and internal politics of Rome leading to incompetents at the helms of large armies. Again, something you attribute to luck for Alexander and skill for Hannibal. One of the greatest skills a general can showcase is understanding when his counterpart makes a strategic blunder and capitalizing on that fact. In the cases of both Hannibal and Alexander, this is a trait they both showcased with extreme effectiveness. No matter what you say, Alexander repeatedly fought forces greater than his own, just like Hannibal, and came out not only on top, but with a vastly lower casualty rate than his foes. Darius and the Persian armies repeatedly outnumbered his own in sheer forces, but Alexander took advantage of the blunders Darius made to score victory after victory. That is not something you can attribute to just luck, and if you want to, I will simply posit that Hannibal's army even making it through the Alps somewhat intact was luckier than any of the situations Alexander found himself in, period. ]"

If any aggressive vibes come about, it's not intended whatsoever) For one, the quality of his victories speak volumes. First let us consider Issus, If we ignore the convenient dying of Memnon rendering the Persian fleet kinda useless at just the perfect time and consider the battle of Issus as an example. Then we can see that the ""brilliance"" of Alexander is obviously romanticized and blown out of proportion. First, once the common Myth of Dariuses Foolishness is overcome by interjecting that Darius was of the correct Persuasion that the Macedonian Army was split, his moves towards issus make sense. As he most likely intended to defeat by detail. However, it was only because of a convenient Storm that his position was made known to Alexander, thus ruining the plan. (source:Murison, C. L. “Darius III and the Battle of Issus.” Historia: Zeitschrift Für Alte Geschichte, vol. 21, no. 3, 1972, pp. 399–423. JSTOR, http://www.jstor.org/stable/4435274. Accessed 9 Aug. 2023.) And forcing Darius to retreat into Issus, and fight on unfavorable terrain, since by chance, they were a few hours late, and Macedon had united as a force. Thus that was the only option. Luck was on Alexanders side. It would take a good general to capitalize on the luck of course, however this advantage saved his neck. Thus, he cannot be called the greatest or unbelievably talented.As he did not produce an ingenius solution, but merely speeded to Parmenion. He exploited his luck in the most unoriginal matter. Not to forget of course that many of the accounts are heavily propagandized (Nicholas G. L. Hammond. “Alexander’s Charge at the Battle of Issus in 333 B.C.” Historia: Zeitschrift Für Alte Geschichte, vol. 41, no. 4, 1992, pp. 395–406. JSTOR, http://www.jstor.org/stable/4436258. Accessed 9 Aug. 2023) And of course here much can be criticized on Darius as well, such as Darius not making use of his advantages he had at hand at Issus. Seeing that the macedonian center was advancing, and that he was the chased price so to speak and would have been pursued, and that Parmenion was kept busy by his cavalry, the obvious move here would have been to retreat while barraging the macedons with archers. Tiring them out. And so, essentially split up the macedon army. Seeing that the macedon center has still not engaged with the enemy, not even Alexander would have been suicidal enough to charge with his cavalry alone.

That doesn’t mean they’re the greatest, it really means that they just accomplished some great feat. Which Alexander indubitably did. If your argument is that he shouldn’t be called “Alexander the greatest”, I agree, because he isn’t called that and he shouldn’t be. But his feat of defeating and subduing the bogeyman who had been tormenting the Greeks for centuries, can’t really be described as nothing short of great imo. As of the ‘luck’ argument, a lot of - if not the majority - of the biggest generals of all time have been very lucky. And capitalizing on that luck is pivotal; Hannibal was lucky about Roman recklessness at Trebi and Trasimene, of course expertly exploited. Julius Caesar was lucky many times, but especially at Pharsalus. Napoleon Bonaparte was also extremely lucky, and he even acknowledged how important ‘luck’ was as a factor in warfare; being quoted that “Ability is of little value without opportunity, I had rather my generals be lucky than able”. ]"

Morover, the suicidality is even increased when you have a potentially disloyal army of mercenaries. And at Cannae, the Romans correctly guessed that the Carthaginian center was the weakest point. So that Hannibal himself came to the center for Moral boost. Hannibal making it that far shows that he produced victories that in Quality, not result alone, but in quality and ingenuity, far outmatch anything Alexander ever did. Furthermore, it is premediated strategy and cunning that is at play most of the time with Hannibal. Not live battlefield adaptation as with Alexander. The plans hannibal developed working most of the time, prove an inherent grasp at how the battlefield will develop, thus not needing to even adapt. Further more, Hannibal has a better grasp at psychology than Alexander. As can be seen by his treatment of of the non latin italic prisoners, his use of Roman pride in baiting and more. Psychological warfare is as important to a general as literal warfare. Now, it can be argued, but he achieved all his goals! Surely that justifies being called THE greatest and unbelievably talented. However, that is simplistic. Consider his grand strategic conditions: mediocre king for a Persian Emperor ruling a declining empire as a rival, a great army left to you by your father, and Egyptians which hate Persia more than they hate you. And of course ancient supply possibilities which rendered the manpower pool of 1 million the persians had effectively useless. Grand Strategically speaking, all the stars align for your victory. Under those conditions you cannot lose as long as you are decent and good which Alexander was. Thus, this accomplishment is blown out of proportion. Contrast this with Hannibals Situation. Hannibal faced the Romans. They would send legion after legion due to sheer relentlessness and will power alone, risking to essentially suicide their own nation just to defeat Hannibal which was unheard of at that time. Alexander, had no such relentless and irrational enemies to fight. Even if Persia was big and vast, it was no Rome, it did not posses Romes grit and determination. At home, the senate of Carthage wont supply you with ships or armies or anything you need. So You are on your own. And in the meantime you win, Spain is being conquered by romans and there is nothing you can do cause you are not omnipresent. And the longer you fight, the longer your tactics might be learned by the enemy. Since not even Hannibal could be ingenius forever. Being 20 Years undefeated in the Roman Backyard under those conditions so to speak, solidifies the greatness Hannibal had. His defeat of course is unsurprising. It was impossible for him to win from a grand strategic standpoint.But making it that far, shows the Brilliance needed to actually be at least candidate to be called the greatest of all time and unbelievably talented. To actually be the greatest of all time, more is needed of course. So not even Hannibal would be the greatest. Now, here it can be argued, but Hannibal whom you say is so great, admired Alexander! Thus, Alexander has to be deserving of higher esteem. Not really. Now, although it is murky and the origins cannot be reliably determined, it is reported that hannibal said, that were it not for his final defeat, that he himself would have been the greatest general and because he lost it remains to be Alexander. We can see that Hannibal thought in terms of results alone and not quality of results. It does not matter if Alexander as a general was not as good as himself, Alexander still never was officially defeated and could claim to have conquered the known world. Thus, Hannibal thought he too would need to at least hold the tittle of never being defeated and his obvious superior qualities as a general would guarannty his place at the top. Thus, Alexander really does not deserve higher esteem because of Hannibals supposed admiration. The reason he, Alexander, was admired, is a rather superficial one. He never lost(but of course is not alone in having done this so it is also not that special), but could also claim to have conquered the known world. This combination, is the winning combination for good propaganda. Being the only man who conquered the world at only 30 years of age is mesmerizing enough to ignore your shortcomings. And of course as a King Personality, he does not come close to Cyrus. As he was detested by his asian subjects, and his arrogance was known to all corners of the world. Thus, Alexander is to be placed lower on the ladder than the likes of Hannibal for General, and the likes of Cyrus for King and Leader.

"Altough basically all your points of criticism can (and should be/already are extensively) be discussed, a large part of your 'essay' seems to center on the argument of luck/ 'Alex was enormously lucky'. This in itself is quite oversimplified, so this will be the focus of this answer. Alexander wasn't 'lucky' because his enemies didn't drive home their advantages, at least this is and cannot be the main factor. Darius (and his advisors and satraps) did the best he could according to their ability, they were not just '80% in the game.' They too, had excellent troops (e.g. Greek mercenaries, cavalry) and able leaders. It is just that the Macedonians (and to a large part Alexander!) were just better and knew how to take advantage of certain situations better. They too, can be criticized for various things, as can be every warlord and king. Alexander was, however, quite good at assessing certain situations and transforming it beforehand or on the go to his own advantage. This happened at Gaugamela as well as in Issos, but also at the Granicus, Aornos or at the Hydaspes. He correctly guessed(or rather: knew) that the Persian cavalry will leave a gap by following his decoy manouever, thus exposing the weak point of their army: Dareios. He also correctly assessed that the Great King will flee when exposed to a certain amount of risk. More often then not, his victories had a battleplan he stuck to and thus achieved victory. Was faced with a impossible dilemma at Gaugamela: pursue the fleeing King or come to the rescue of Parmenion's badly mauled left wing? As we know, his decision was the correct one, but once again this is not a result of luck, but of him calculating pros and cons in mid-battle. I could go on, bit this should suffice to explain my stance. Furthermore, your essay ignores that Alexander was not some kind of anomaly luck-wise. Livy himself said ""To a good general, luck is important"", and thus, all great victories can be simplified by attributing them to luck and ignoring all the other factors that lead to said victories. By assuming that every leader has some sort of luck during his campaigns, they can be crossed out out of the equation completely, leaving the other factors. You mentioned Hannibal achieved his victories with more ""quality"" and against more odds? Yet he too, can be seen as having had a lot of luck. The Romans could've discovered or guessed his route trough the Alps a lot sooner, rendering the effect of surprise useless. His centre could've broken a lot sooner at Cannae, and his stratagem at the Campanian Fields could've worked either way. However, it is obvious that all these successes are mainly the results of his brilliance as a general, just as Alexander's exploits are. Both were seen as 'Great', even during their own lifetime, and neither was called particularly lucky. Edit: some spelling mistakes","[-8&&ObadiahTheEmperor&& Your reply is most appreciated. While I do agree that all Generals have a certain Luck element that always plays a role in their victories, the kind, scale and role of the luck has to be considered. Alexander using the luck he had as any general should is not my point of criticism. My point of criticism is that he had such kinds of luck, that his skills as a general were amplified, as it would not have happened in normal lucky circumstances to others. Hannibal too had luck of course. But his luck is offset by first, the strategically unfavorable conditions he was fighting in, and the scale of it. Taking your example with Canae. The center not breaking, is luck. Him being discovered later is also luck. But it does not make victory more achievable than it already was. Hannibal demonstrates that he is able to artificially create the surprise element throughout his campaign, thus his lucky moments just eliminate risk factors, but do not amplify his skills greatly or save him from certain doom. And him making use of those small moments demonstrates skill rather than fortune. The storm revealing Dariuses position on the other hand is crucial. (storms wrexking his fleet earlier and Memnon conveniently dying are also crucial) Alexander would have been defeated since he had no clue of Dariuses position if it were not for the storm. Thus, his lucky moments already amplify his skills to a degree that other Generals did not enjoy and save him from certain doom. Since that is the case, he is obviously to be categorized lower than other greats. It does not mean he was not great. Not at all. Only that he was not as great as Alexander boos make him out to be.

Chronologically: What determines if sth can not happen to others in similar circumstances? Why can others not have simlar luck? McClellan found Lees plans before Antietam, wrapped around some cigars. He still couldn't win Antietam with a great nunerical superiority. He had a rather big stroke of luck and didn't capitalize on that. Similarly, the French can be said to be lucky that 3/4 of the English Army was suffering from dysentery before Agincourt. With double the numbers, they were still left badly mauled in the mud. Once again, you have to act on lucky circumstances, nd not everybody did. So what makes Alex luck particularly extraordinary? That He was lucky to act on lucky circumstance? Next, Hannibal was not more in adversity than Alexander. Can we even measure adversity? They had simular situations, deep in enemy territory, trashing numerically superior armies. If anything, Alexander took a greater risk as the Persian Empire was vastly Bagger than the Roman Republic, and there was a substantial possibility of the Greek Cities and Thrace rising up in rebellion. Carthage, at the time, was stable. I wouldn't say Cannae was achievable from the get-go. The Romans had every right to think that this would be their battle. The center held just barely, according to Hannibals plan, that's why he positioned himself there for some crucial morale support. After the battle, his casualities were so great that he could forget to march on Rome for good, notwithstanding the ~60.000 Roman losses. Gaugamela too, was close. Alexander met Dareios on a Persian-prepared field, cleared for Chariot warfare. They had the numbers and the skill. Several hundred cavalry actually broke through and got to the Macedonian Camp, but were met and held in check, to give Alexander the time needed to rout Dareios and relieve Parmenion. So, both battles could've gone either way, if was a matter of luck - as always- but not really more in one than in the other. Once again, it was their respective generals skill. I still don't understand which particular skill was amplified with Alexander which the other generals did not enjoy? Alexander has his fanboys, yes. But he was undoubtedly great military-wise, and there is no need/no factuaö basis to boil that down to luck. If you want to trash him, he has more than enough other buttons you can push. ]"

You mean to say you think the practice of throwing as many troops at a battle as it takes to win is ""conventionally sound"" tactically? No, that's as basic as it gets and exactly what Darius tried to do. In the case of both Persia and Rome, the beginning of their empires were founded on superior tactics AND equipment, and then they got complacent and relied on numerical superiority and a handful of genius military leaders to push them through any challenges. Darius was not one of those, and thus Alexander toppled him much easier than he ""should"" have. Rome employed the same tactics using terrible generals save for a very select few to fight Hannibal, namely Scipio, being the only one who could even hold a candle to him. Let us also note how little Scipio and Hannibal actually faced off, correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe they only actually faced each other a couple of times, with Scipio coming out on top at Zama. The few times Rome's most competent general battled Hannibal, it amounted to either a proverbial draw or a victory for Rome. That is not the point at all.

You can call it luck all you want, that doesn't make Alexander less of a general. Not to mention storms don't just impact one army. It's not as though only Darius suffered from the effects of a storm. It's also not as though storms simply appeared by 'magic.'

"Undoubtedly, some or even most of what Hannibal knew came from tales of Alexander's conquests and strategic deployments in the first place seeing as he lived 100 years prior, and he studied his tactics greatly and used them to great effect. While it is possible, I highly doubt it. Most of Hannibals tactics show cunning that Alexanders simply lack. An influence is not apparent. Sure, plenty can be attributed to luck, but you criticize Alexander for making foolish and/or crazy decisions while simultaneously praising Hannibal for invading through the Alps, an idea you yourself admit to be basically suicidal. That it worked out is your proof that Hannibal was superior Not exactly. Rather, it is to illustrate that The Romans were not being stupid in their Blunders. And that what they did was conventionally sound. In contrast to Dariuses Blunders. Him failing to use his advantages is not something the Romans did. In fact, they actively used their advantages and still failed. Darius on the other hand would have succeeded. Rome did not have dozens of supreme generals in which Hannibal defeated soundly. He mostly engaged incompetents or average leaders, compounded by the infighting and internal politics of Rome leading to incompetents at the helms of large armies. Again, something you attribute to luck for Alexander and skill for Hannibal. That is not the point at all. Rather, the point is that Romes numerical advantage would allow them to eventually unveil Hannibals tactics. For this, great generalship is not needed whatsover. Only relentlessness and numbers. Alexander was not under such risks from the Persians. Another point in which Alexander had more favorable strategic conditions. One of the greatest skills a general can showcase is understanding when his counterpart makes a strategic blunder and capitalizing on that fact. In the cases of both Hannibal and Alexander, this is a trait they both showcased with extreme effectiveness. And nowhere is that being disputed. No matter what you say, Alexander repeatedly fought forces greater than his own, just like Hannibal, and came out not only on top, but with a vastly lower casualty rate than his foes. Darius and the Persian armies repeatedly outnumbered his own in sheer forces, but Alexander took advantage of the blunders Darius made to score victory after victory. The blunders Darius made were in not properly utlizing his advantages, as he still could have won. Up to that point his decisions were conventional and sound and can hardly be called blunders. Were it not for Alexanders lucky storms, and tempests and deaths and what not, Darius would have won each encounter. Are you denying for example that had the Storm not made Dariuses position known, that Alexander would have lost? In case you do, I am very curious to hear your argumentation for that.

Throwing soldiers at the problem till it goes away is not really a Blunder but an approach and what eventually allowed them to win against hannibal. It was unsound, and irrational. And that is exactly the point. But I would not call it a blunder, as the Romans could afford it. exactly what Darius tried to do. When did Darius relenntlessly build Army after Army facing Alexander, with the same Spirit Rome did? Relying on numerical advantage during a battle is something that is conventional. It did not mirror the suicidal tendency of rome to never give up. What is your point here? In the case of both Persia and Rome, the beginning of their empires were founded on superior tactics AND equipment, and then they got complacent and relied on numerical superiority and a handful of genius military leaders to push them through any challenges.

The few times Rome's most competent general battled Hannibal, it amounted to either a proverbial draw or a victory for Rome. Yes. But Hannibals victories were circulated during the entire time, and Scipio was presumably at Cannae as well. Eventually leading to Scipio seeing the Pattern in Hannibals approach and copying it at Zama. It was bound to happen due to Roman relentlessness. They did not have to face each other often for Scipio to do basic battle analysis. The Persians did not outnumber the Macedonians to the same degree the Romans outnumbered the Carthaginians, The Persians had a manpower pool of 1 million. But Darius was not Roman so he did not use that pool by making Army after Army. the Persian army employed the same strategy the Romans did in numerous cases of simply trying to overwhelm Alexander with numerical advantage, because it had worked in other regions against lesser generals. It did not work against Alexander. It is the conventionally sound thing to do. There is literally no way to know who would have won or not.

Of this we can be certain. How would a battle have faired with or without a storm present is an irrelevant point to make, frankly. You can call it luck all you want, that doesn't make Alexander less of a general. So, let me illustrate if for you. You and your two friends play hide and seek. Your two friends split. You cunningly follow the one from a distance. You know if you catch him, the other one will have to give up. And you smile and are smug- And then suddenly, it thunders and you scream out of fear( this is oversimplified ofc), revealing your position. Upon hearing this, your two friends join up and you have sealed your deal. Are you saying that your other friend, who had no clue you were this close on capturing the first one, would magically intuit where you are and join up and still win? Who's to say Alexander didn't understand the storm would be coming and positioned his army accordingly to take advantage? If you want to play the ""what if"" card then I'll do just the same back. He had no clue Darius was in the North and expected him to come from the South. All the sources say this. Why would you imply a hypothetical scenario that is not even probable? He literally had to speed to Parmenion once he heard that Darius was near due to being forced to Reveal his position after the storm. And by mere luck, once more, managed it before Darius. Who then out of fury retreated at Issus and let his anger out on the Sick and Wounded Macedons. The source I linked explains this. ]"

The seventh or eighth century Life of St Samson says that Germanus was the instructor of Illtud. And many other examples could be given. But the problem is that many of these references are completely chronologically incompatible with Germanus of Auxerre, since he died in 448. For example, Dubricius is generally held to have been born in about 465, long after that Germanus had died. The Life of St Samson shows that Illtud’s lifetime overlapped considerably with that of Samson, yet Samson is shown to have outlived Conomor, who died in 560. So Illtud could not have been instructed by Germanus of Auxerre. My theory (and this is something which quite a few scholars have suggested before, including the well-respected David Dumville) is that there was a second Germanus, one who lived in the latter part of the fifth century. Interestingly, there is a record of Patrick having a disciple named Germanus, whom he set up as bishop of the Isle of Man. Since Patrick was active in the second half of the fifth century, this Germanus would be perfectly placed chronologically to be the Germanus of most of the medieval British texts. However, I believe that at least one of these references is best explained by a third Germanus. The eighth century Life of St Brioc specifically notes that Illtud was sent to be taught by Germanus in Paris. Interestingly, we know that there was a bishop of Paris called Germanus in the mid sixth century. Therefore, this would logically be the Germanus who instructed Illtud, and this would allow Illtud’s life to comfortably overlap that of Samson, who lived to see Conomor’s death in 560.","[5&&buteo51&& On the one hand, it would be shocking if there weren’t multiple people named Germanus in northwest Europe over more than a century.

From our perspective, it feels like there must be a fundamental difference between details that seem plausible to us and those that don't, but that fundamental difference did not exist for the authors and consumers of the text.

Since we know the author cannot have been working from true information when they wrote about angelic visions and sea monsters (unless you believe in that sort of thing), we know that someone, at some point, felt comfortable adding impossibilities and fictional events to the story. This doesn't mean we should think of them as liars either - the strict separation of fact and fiction when writing about the past is a modern phenomenon. The 'truth' of the text was in the saintliness being portrayed, not in the hard facts. In modern parlance, hagiographies, panegyrics, and similar documents were all about the vibe. Now in this case, it's quite possible that the author of the hagiography intended St. Germaine of Paris and not St. Germanus of Auxerre. These were two quite separate men, both of great significance. It's also quite possible that the author didn't know that there were two different St. Germanuses at all, or that Iltud and Auxerre being contemporaries was implausible, and neither did their readers. In many cases, we do have better information about the past than early medieval writers did. Take the confusion of Gildas and later Bede regarding the origins of Hadrian's Wall as an example. My broader point is that trying to draw conclusions about early medieval events from the content of hagiographies is like building on quicksand. If we encounter obvious factual errors in them, the simpler conclusion is to take them as errors, and not to surmise the existence of unknown facts that would make them true. ]"

I can automatically think of numerous instances from antiquity which demonstrate that various writers really did have a sense of distinguishing truth from fact. It is certainly not a modern concept. I do think, however, that people were perfectly comfortable with inventing details, such as an angelic visitation. Did the writers expect that the audience would understand that those details were invented? No, I don't think they did at all. I think everything indicates that they created those details to be believed as real events. Hence, they did have a concern for what was or was not plausible. We might not think that angelic visitations are plausible, so we might make no difference between them and someone appearing anachronistically. But back then, that was not the case. Angelic visitations would not have appeared unbelievable. Therefore, they cannot be used to justify a lack of concern for believable chronology. ]"

Guerrilla warfare. I started researching medieval and ancient conflicts, when the people used unconventional warfare. It all started when I went down a rabbit hole of declassified documents from the Korean War and Japanese Colonization. One of the cool things about being Korean is when you find out what your family clan is, you find a whole world of heroes and villains. From an Indepence fighter who was posthumously awarded a medal, his body was exhumed and he rests at the Korean equivalent of Arlington. To a Japanese collaborator who's name is in a national book of 4000 traitors. I am learning about one of my relatives back in the Imjin War. He was a famous guerrilla leader that waged an insurgency. It wasn't just him, there were alot of famous people that did the same. Everything from sabotage, subversion, disinformation, psychological warfare (body mutilation), espionage, and assassinations. I read about how they would stage hit and run attacks and cut off their supply, starve them and get them to defect. The Navy completely cut off all their supplies and the guerillas did the rest. My family clan were high ranking during Goreyeo empire. Back when it was a confederation of war clans and war was constant. Fought everyone and when the mongols finally defeated us, we did the same thing that we did during the Imjin wars. We were still standing and ready to fight to new Ming dynasty. Only to get back stabbed by a General. Who created the Joseon Dynasty, with its backward culture that turned us into rabbits. When times get like that we always result back to what we know best. ]"

Their slaughter of innocent civilians matched the same thing they did in WW2. Insanely barbaric what they did.,"[33&&SickMoo1&& It did not. In WW2, massacres were explicitly carried out, and those were special circumstances, not the norm. In Imjin war, or the long civil war in Japan prior to it, the standard practice was to kill everyone and everything inside besieged cities. Nothing would be left alive. One of the exceptions was Oda Nobunaga's siege of armed Buddhists' castle, in which he ordered soldiers to chase and exterminate anyone who got away. It was not ""subhumanize"" as others mentioned. They did it to everyone including their own, and they took no POWs. In fact they were ordered to be nice in Korea by Toyotomi, so that was them being nice. In comparison, Ming soldiers or mercenaries only murdered civilians when they needed to collect enough heads for rewards, because they still followed the system of measuring performance by enemy heads. PS: It's also unlike Genghis' systematic and purposefully massacre, but more like a tradition of war. In fact, they couldn't figure out why Joseon peasants ran away from farms. ]"

The treaty of Lausanne though is a very nice case study that can be applied to many of those situations because: it happened after the onset of the establishment of a true (as much as that can be claimed) liberal and law based world order (think of the League of Nations) happened at a time when 3 empires collapsed almost simultaneously - giving the opportunity to many of the oppressed and minority groups to free themselves happened arguably the peak of European (colonial) power when UK and France achieved the height of territorial expansion and influence. Hence, they were free to mold a big chunk of the world based on their values and finally the treaty fo Lausanne concerned the first academically agreed Genocide of the 20th century which was dubbed a ""crime against Humanity"" by the Entente in 1915 in which they also made a promise to prosecute the persons responsible for it (which ofc they didn't). Essentially, this serves as an excellent example as to what happens when the guilty are not punished but are even rewarded for their crimes: it sets up for even more gruesome horrors on a larger scale. The connection between what Turkey and Kemal achieved (including the treaty of Lausanne) and the spineless conduct of UK, France and the US is what inspired in quite some degree the Nazis and Hitler himself.

Well, your task as a scholar or scientist is to arrive at conclusions. Yes, accumulating evidence is super valuable, but it's not enough. It has to be used for something.

"Hittite was an Indo-European language in Asia Minor, though they’re much later than the origin time.","[30&&Bentresh&& Yes, the traditional view has been that Anatolian-speakers migrated into Anatolia sometime around 3000 BCE. There is no consensus on whether the migration was from the west (the Balkans) or from the east, nor whether Hittite, Palaic, and the Luwic languages had already split by the time Anatolian-speakers entered Anatolia. To quote Craig Melchert's chapter ""Indo-Europeans"" in the The Oxford Handbook of Ancient Anatolia, The chief problem with the thesis of Renfrew (1987) is that we may securely reconstruct for the PIE lexicon words for objects and activities that almost certainly did not exist in 7000 B.C.E. or any time close to that. See Barber (2001) and especially Darden (2001) for detailed arguments for the PIE words for “wool” (as a material suitable for spinning), “yoke,” and “hitch-pole.” If the Anatolian Indo-European languages have been in situ in Anatolia for five millennia when we first encounter them, as claimed by Renfrew, it is also scarcely credible that there is no evidence for loanwords into Proto-Anatolian from Sumerian, Semitic, or Hattic (or vice versa). Pace Simon (2006:317), the lack of evidence for such contacts cannot be explained due to geographical distance, which is minimal. Nor would the contacts in the fourth and third millennia B.C.E. have been only with proto-languages, since Sumerian dates from at least the fourth millennium B.C.E. and Akkadian from the third millennium B.C.E. The openness of Hittite to lexical loans (though not grammatical influence) once it did come into contact with other languages of the Ancient Near East suggests that there should have likewise been such influence in earlier periods, had opportunity for such contact existed. The weight of current evidence argues for the received view of Indo-European speakers as intrusive to Anatolia.... The fact that the Assyrian texts from Kaneš from the nineteenth to the eighteenth centuries B.C.E. attest to already distinct Hittite and Luvian, combined with the demonstration by Yakubovich of prehistoric Luvian influence on Hittite grammar, likewise necessarily after the two grammatical systems had already significantly diverged, falsifies any notion of a still undifferentiated Anatolian form of Indo-European at the end of the second millennium B.C.E. (contra MacQueen 1996:31). The differences cited between Luvian and the western Anatolian languages reinforce this conclusion. One may safely say that a consensus has therefore developed that divergences among the Anatolian Indo-European languages can have begun no later than ca. 2300 B.C.E. and likely began earlier, arguably as early as the beginning of the third millennium B.C.E. See, among others, Carruba (1995:31), Lehrman (2001:116), Oettinger (2002:52), and Yakubovich (2010:7). This convergence of opinion is all the more significant in that these scholars and others have widely divergent views regarding other aspects of Anatolian and Indo-European linguistic prehistory. We take it as a given that the spread of Indo-European languages across Asia Minor involved at least some movements of speakers. Since geographic separation of an originally unified speech community typically leads to language differentiation between the respective new communities, the default assumption is that most (if not all) of the early attested divergence among the Anatolian languages is due to the break-up of what we call “Proto-Anatolian,” as various groups of speakers scattered into areas of Anatolia. However, the methods of reconstruction that lead us to posit a prehistoric language system like Proto-Anatolian imply only that the attested languages in question underwent some period of common development that differentiates them from the rest of the Indo-European languages. Where this putative common development took place cannot be determined on linguistic grounds. We therefore cannot rule out an alternative scenario by which the isolation that led to Proto-Anatolian took place in, for example, the Balkans, and that the entry of its speakers into Anatolia took place in a series of successive waves (thus Steiner 1990:202–3; see also Darden 2001:220). Even the approximate date of entry of Indo-European speakers into Anatolia thus remains frustratingly indeterminate... David Anthony's The Horse, the Wheel, and Language includes some approximate dates for branches of IE. The oldest branch to split away was, without any doubt, Pre-Anatolian. Pre-Tocharian probably separated next, although it also showed some later traits. The next branching event separated Pre-Celtic and Pre-Italic from the still evolving core. Germanic has some archaic traits that suggest an initial separation at about the same time as Pre-Celtic and Pre-Italic, but then later it was strongly affected by borrowing from Celtic, Baltic, and Slavic, so the precise time it split away is uncertain. Pre-Greek separated after Italic and Celtic, followed by Indo-Iranian. The innovations of Indo-Iranian were shared (perhaps later) with several language groups in southeastern Europe (Pre-Armenian, Pre-Albanian, partly in Pre-Phrygian) and in the forests of Europe (Pre-Baltic and Pre-Slavic). Common Indo-Iranian, we must remember, is dated at the latest to about 1700 BCE. The Ringe-Tarnow branching diagram puts the separations of Anatolian, Tocharian, Italic, Celtic, German, and Greek before this. Anatolian probably had split away before 3500 BCE, Italic and Celtic before 2500 BCE, Greek after 2500 BCE, and Proto-Indo-Iranian by 2000 BCE. Those are not meant to be exact dates, but they are in the right sequence, are linked to dated inscriptions in three places (Greek, Anatolian, and Old Indic), and make sense. By 2500 BCE the language that has been reconstructed as Proto-Indo-European had evolved into something else or, more accurately, a variety of things, –late dialects such as Pre-Greek and Pre-Indo-Iranian that continued to diverge in different ways in different places. The Indo-European languages that evolved after 2500 BCE did not develop from Proto-Indo-European but from a set of intermediate Indo-European languages that preserved and passed along aspects of the mother tongue. By 2500 BCE Proto-Indo-European was a dead language. ]"

"Yes, the traditional view has been that Anatolian-speakers migrated into Anatolia sometime around 3000 BCE. There is no consensus on whether the migration was from the west (the Balkans) or from the east, nor whether Hittite, Palaic, and the Luwic languages had already split by the time Anatolian-speakers entered Anatolia. To quote Craig Melchert's chapter ""Indo-Europeans"" in the The Oxford Handbook of Ancient Anatolia, The chief problem with the thesis of Renfrew (1987) is that we may securely reconstruct for the PIE lexicon words for objects and activities that almost certainly did not exist in 7000 B.C.E. or any time close to that. See Barber (2001) and especially Darden (2001) for detailed arguments for the PIE words for “wool” (as a material suitable for spinning), “yoke,” and “hitch-pole.” If the Anatolian Indo-European languages have been in situ in Anatolia for five millennia when we first encounter them, as claimed by Renfrew, it is also scarcely credible that there is no evidence for loanwords into Proto-Anatolian from Sumerian, Semitic, or Hattic (or vice versa). Pace Simon (2006:317), the lack of evidence for such contacts cannot be explained due to geographical distance, which is minimal. Nor would the contacts in the fourth and third millennia B.C.E. have been only with proto-languages, since Sumerian dates from at least the fourth millennium B.C.E. and Akkadian from the third millennium B.C.E. The openness of Hittite to lexical loans (though not grammatical influence) once it did come into contact with other languages of the Ancient Near East suggests that there should have likewise been such influence in earlier periods, had opportunity for such contact existed. The weight of current evidence argues for the received view of Indo-European speakers as intrusive to Anatolia.... The fact that the Assyrian texts from Kaneš from the nineteenth to the eighteenth centuries B.C.E. attest to already distinct Hittite and Luvian, combined with the demonstration by Yakubovich of prehistoric Luvian influence on Hittite grammar, likewise necessarily after the two grammatical systems had already significantly diverged, falsifies any notion of a still undifferentiated Anatolian form of Indo-European at the end of the second millennium B.C.E. (contra MacQueen 1996:31). The differences cited between Luvian and the western Anatolian languages reinforce this conclusion. One may safely say that a consensus has therefore developed that divergences among the Anatolian Indo-European languages can have begun no later than ca. 2300 B.C.E. and likely began earlier, arguably as early as the beginning of the third millennium B.C.E. See, among others, Carruba (1995:31), Lehrman (2001:116), Oettinger (2002:52), and Yakubovich (2010:7). This convergence of opinion is all the more significant in that these scholars and others have widely divergent views regarding other aspects of Anatolian and Indo-European linguistic prehistory. We take it as a given that the spread of Indo-European languages across Asia Minor involved at least some movements of speakers. Since geographic separation of an originally unified speech community typically leads to language differentiation between the respective new communities, the default assumption is that most (if not all) of the early attested divergence among the Anatolian languages is due to the break-up of what we call “Proto-Anatolian,” as various groups of speakers scattered into areas of Anatolia. However, the methods of reconstruction that lead us to posit a prehistoric language system like Proto-Anatolian imply only that the attested languages in question underwent some period of common development that differentiates them from the rest of the Indo-European languages. Where this putative common development took place cannot be determined on linguistic grounds. We therefore cannot rule out an alternative scenario by which the isolation that led to Proto-Anatolian took place in, for example, the Balkans, and that the entry of its speakers into Anatolia took place in a series of successive waves (thus Steiner 1990:202–3; see also Darden 2001:220). Even the approximate date of entry of Indo-European speakers into Anatolia thus remains frustratingly indeterminate... David Anthony's The Horse, the Wheel, and Language includes some approximate dates for branches of IE. The oldest branch to split away was, without any doubt, Pre-Anatolian. Pre-Tocharian probably separated next, although it also showed some later traits. The next branching event separated Pre-Celtic and Pre-Italic from the still evolving core. Germanic has some archaic traits that suggest an initial separation at about the same time as Pre-Celtic and Pre-Italic, but then later it was strongly affected by borrowing from Celtic, Baltic, and Slavic, so the precise time it split away is uncertain. Pre-Greek separated after Italic and Celtic, followed by Indo-Iranian. The innovations of Indo-Iranian were shared (perhaps later) with several language groups in southeastern Europe (Pre-Armenian, Pre-Albanian, partly in Pre-Phrygian) and in the forests of Europe (Pre-Baltic and Pre-Slavic). Common Indo-Iranian, we must remember, is dated at the latest to about 1700 BCE. The Ringe-Tarnow branching diagram puts the separations of Anatolian, Tocharian, Italic, Celtic, German, and Greek before this. Anatolian probably had split away before 3500 BCE, Italic and Celtic before 2500 BCE, Greek after 2500 BCE, and Proto-Indo-Iranian by 2000 BCE. Those are not meant to be exact dates, but they are in the right sequence, are linked to dated inscriptions in three places (Greek, Anatolian, and Old Indic), and make sense. By 2500 BCE the language that has been reconstructed as Proto-Indo-European had evolved into something else or, more accurately, a variety of things, –late dialects such as Pre-Greek and Pre-Indo-Iranian that continued to diverge in different ways in different places. The Indo-European languages that evolved after 2500 BCE did not develop from Proto-Indo-European but from a set of intermediate Indo-European languages that preserved and passed along aspects of the mother tongue. By 2500 BCE Proto-Indo-European was a dead language.",[6&&Bobbias&& I just want to say as a non-linguist (and non-student) this was an absolutely fascinating read. ]

But that paper mainly consisted of fairly vague arguments with little foundations. There are lots and lots of sources of data that we could look at to help us determine what happened, but those were just ignored. Ultimately, the feeling I was left with was that the authors wanted to discuss the issue, but they had no particular desire to find out what actually happened. Yet there is an answer. Either volcanic eruption causing climate change triggered this societal change, or it did not. Given that other sources have estimated that half the population died I know which side I favour. Even I, a non-specialist, know this extremely relevant fact, but the guys who wrote the paper either didn't or ignored it. Not very impressive scholarship. At the same time i do get your point and to some extent i'd agree with that. I have to say the same. It's OK to publish papers that basically only provide data without drawing conclusions.

To me, the most likely theory is that all language families are related, except that their common ancestors are tens of thousands of years away rather than just a couple of millenia.

The argument is that most IE language families have words that are cognate that correspond to technologies/techniques/animals that only became common during the hypothesized PIE period ca. 3000 BCE. In other words, how would the word for ""horse"" be cognate between Ancient Latin and Ancient Hittite if these languages split before the horse was domesticated (as seems to proposed in this paper)? I think the answer lies in that they seemed to solely rely on statistical analysis, rather than a combination of linguistics and archeology.","[1&&Leading-Okra-2457&& You don't need to domesticate an animal inorder call it a name, right? ]"

As a selling point, Magellan proclaimed his belief that the Spice Islands were located inside the Spanish realm delineated by the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas, in which Spain and Portugal agreed to divide the non-Christian world between them. Magellan may actually have believed this, because he had a friend, Portuguese mariner Francisco Serrão, who had settled in the Spice Islands and wrote Magellan letters in which he placed the islands far to the east of where they actually were.

This word also shows up a lot in a different inscription that you know is about the statue of Liberty. You think it might be saying ""New York"" so you start applying sounds to signs. ""Нью""must sound like ""New"", ""Йо́рк"" like ""York"". Then you can apply this knowledge to other words. Of course you only know a few sounds. Basically, but in reality it's more complicated. For example, I assumed this ""Нью-Йо́рк"" was written left to right but it could have been written right to left.

Iberians and Romans also did not prefer sword and shield. They preferred javelins. In fact, the Romans returned to the spear, but one can simply not discard the main weapon why they ditched the spear, which was the pilum. Greek hoplites had perfectly fine swords as well, incidently by the late era also introducing plenty of javelins into the equipment of heavy infantry what formerly was near exclusively a skirmishing weapon. Similar for Aztecs by the way. Generally main line infantry usually got a pointy stick. Specialized troops were the ones deviating, either as elite shock troops, or for special purposes.

Review copied from my Goodreads. 3.75/5 The book is about how various works by classical authors survived the decline of the Western Roman Empire, were translated and transferred in the Muslim World and eventually made their way back to Europe. In terms of time period covers roughly 500AD to 1500AD ending with the creation of the printing press. Personally I preferred the bits that focussed on the big picture - networks of trade and intellectuals, manuscripts being shipped about, the political conditions that led certain places to be successful centres of learning etc. The seven cities in order are (classical and pre-Islamic) Alexandria, (Islamic) Baghdad and Cordoba, (Christian) Toledo, Salerno, Palermo and Venice. The book is a reasonable length at 290 pages and for someone like myself who hasn't read much about this topic I found it fairly enjoyable and accessible. Most of my criticisms come down to personal taste. A lot of the book is biographical - X was an important translator, Y was a local bigwig or king who had a giant private collection of manuscripts but this is mentioned in each chapter for each city. On the one hand this does make the book easier to read and more accessible but if (like me) you struggle with remembering names of people then a lot of these will quickly be forgotten. Additionally the book is heavily focussed on medicine, astronomy and mathematics, if you want stuff on how classical philosophical works (Plato, Aristotle etc) survived and made there way back to Europe then there isn't a lot considering the premise of the book.

Maier's Resistance to Revolution and American Scripture are probably the two best books on the subject. The only works that are even in contention with her, IMHO, are Taylor's American Revolutions. They're both excellent scholars. There's some great popular biographies of George Washington, Alexis Coe's You Never Forget Your First and Peter Stark's Young Washington, that are great ways to dip your toe into the topic. Five Books has this good list on the American Revolution: https://fivebooks.com/best-books/american-revolution-t-h-breen/ Thomas Rick's book, First Principles is kind of an easy introduction to the intellectual climate during the period. Forrest MacDonald's Novus Ordo Seclorum is a more in depth book on the intellectual climate at the time. I'd definitely recommend that. You can find Joseph Addison's Cato: A Tragedy pretty easily now a days. It was the most popular play at the time. Washington saw it multiple times and a lot of the more famous quotes from the period are actually from that play. Things like Henry's ""Give me liberty or give me death."" and Hale's ""I regret that I only have one life to give to my country."" were both from that play. But, it's a good way to see what the equivalent of the popular media was like at the time. ]"
[116&&goodoneforyou&&POST=The History of Enucleation for Sympathetic Ophthalmia in the United States during the Civil War (1861-1865)],"[18&&goodoneforyou&& Background. Sympathetic ophthalmia is a condition in which an injury to one eye can cause blindness to the other eye due to an autoimmune response. During the 1800s, enucleation (surgical removal) of a traumatized eye for prevention or treatment of sympathetic ophthalmia became established, but the degree to which this procedure was performed during the U.S. Civil War has been poorly documented. Methods. We reviewed descriptions of enucleation of traumatized eyes during the United States Civil War. Results. Union soldiers sustained 1199 gunshot wounds to the eyes. Among the 825 soldiers with severe unilateral ocular injury, it is recorded that 91 (11%) sustained sympathetic ophthalmia. Diagnostic criteria were poorly specified in that era, and this rate is undoubtedly an overestimate. As we are informed of only one enucleation among a Union soldier who had a “sympathizing” eye, it cannot be established that wartime enucleation was a standard treatment for established sympathetic ophthalmia during the Civil War, though it may have occurred on occasion. Boston surgeon Hasket Derby performed an enucleation of an eye with a fish hook injury to prevent sympathetic ophthalmia in October 1863, but published the case too late to influence the war. If enucleation in the setting of unilateral ocular trauma had been routinely performed to prevent sympathetic ophthalmia, we might have seen hundreds of enucleations among the 825 Union soldiers. However, we are informed of just two additional enucleations, which are not clearly specified as relating to sympathetic ophthalmia. Conclusion. Enucleation of the traumatized eye for the treatment of sympathetic ophthalmia was performed occasionally in the United States during the Civil War, including in one soldier, but was not a standard procedure during the War. Enucleation of the traumatized eye for prevention of sympathetic ophthalmia has not been clearly documented among soldiers during the War, and was also unlikely to have been a standard procedure. ]"

So because they didn’t take the bad eye out they would just go blind in both or die?,"[4&&goodoneforyou&& Well, most of the Civil War soldiers who got shot in the head and would have pain and inflammation in both eyes didn't really have the condition sympathetic ophthalmia, even if sometimes later in the war their doctors thought the patient had this condition. Most times they had pain in both eyes it would be because the bullet passed near or through both eyes, and their whole head hurt like hell. And of course, these patients were at grave risk of dying from blood loss, infection, brain injury, etc. The paper linked to by this post provides descriptions of the soldiers and how some of them died. Actually, two of the surgeons who surgically removed people's eyes actually died from disease, as outlined in the paper! The times were dangerous for everyone! True sympathetic ophthalmia is reasonably rare. Today, you'll see numbers quoted like 1 in 500 severe eye injuries, although the paper linked to by this post doesn't provide a modern estimate. Undoubtedly, some of the soldiers in the Civil War who were said to have sympathetic ophthalmia really did have it. And the treatment of their specific condition would be up to the particular surgeon who treated them during or after the war. If the most severely injured eye had pain, had a retained foreign body, was suppurating, or was blocking the surgeon from accessing a posterior foreign body, the surgeon might indeed remove the eye. As outlined in the paper, at least one soldier who was thought to have pain due to the good eye ""sympathizing"" with the bad eye did have the bad eye removed during the Civil War. But most times, the surgeons in the Civil War would not routinely remove the more severely injured eye, just to prevent the other eye from becoming inflamed. By the way, the degree to which removing the injured eye actually helps in treatment of established sympathetic ophthalmia, or prevents contralateral eye inflammation if performed within a certain time period, is still not completely known or agreed upon. There are no randomized controlled trials. So, the best option is still a matter of debate among ophthalmologists. People are still publishing papers about this! As we now have better anti-inflammatory medicines, like steroids, and newer-generation agents, we can do a better job of treating inflammation if it arises. So, many eye doctors would be reluctant to remove an eye which has any vision at all. Even if your left eye is your bad eye today, if you have an accident and injure your right eye, then all of a sudden your left eye is your better eye. So, for many eye doctors, an eye that has any vision should be left in place, and if the patient needs anti-inflammatory medicines, then so be it. But, I should say, that not all eye surgeons would agree in every case, and there may be exceptions to the rule. ]"

Geopolitics - who were the superpowers to be emulated), and who were the colonized to be appropriated and adapted as exotic markers of distinction? What items were valued enough to import given the costs and risks, and what was their trade value? What written and unwritten laws existed on who had access to certain goods sought to stabilize class mobility (but betrays the existence of a challenge to that order)? For garments, what is the life cycle of a garment - who first wears it, how is it adapted or repaired, who receives it afterwards, and so on…? The entire socio-economic structure is written on a single item. On this last point of recycling, I recently found out about the small size bias for historical clothing. We often see a lot of very small sized items in museums, but historians know that modern people are not that much on average larger than our ancestors (measurements exist from tailors and dressmakers). The theory is that garments of small framed adults reached end-of-line after first use, packed away, because no one could inherit them. You can’t make a dress for a upper class 12 year old upsize to fit the adult maid in the house without finding extra matching fabric. ]"

[309&&Welshhoppo&&POST=The Hyphasis Mutiny],"[62&&imgrandojjo&& The really surprising thing about the mutiny on the Hydaspes River is how long it took to happen. In other words how long Alexander marched his men through hell before they finally had their bellies full of it The Macedonian army had accomplished things that no other army would ever do again, and even its last battle against Pontus was a victory, But the men in that army had campaigned for most of their lives and a lot of them simply wanted to be done with the part of their lives where they could be called on to kill people every day. They wanted to take their pay and find a life for themselves while they still had a few years left to enjoy it. To that end, completing the conquest of Persia made sense to these men, so that that threat couldn't rise again. War against whole new empires should be the job of a new generation of younger men who were not already worn thin by decades of war. They had seen enough and were ready to end their watch with honor. So when Alexander tried to begin a whole new war against Pontus, without rotating any of his men home first, it's not surprising his veterans finally lost patience and told him, in no uncertain terms, it is enough. The greater surprise is that they'd held on as long as they had, longer than any other army fighting under any other king. Very few kings could have held tat army as together as long as Alexander, long enough to conquer the entirety of the world's largest empire in a single lifetime. The next closest achievement I can think of in recorded history is the Caesarian conquest of Gaul, and Caesar had far more mutiny problems in those campaigns. ]"
[309&&Welshhoppo&&POST=The Hyphasis Mutiny],"[17&&princetonwu&& I was going to make a separate post about this, that the reason for Alexander's continued push to India was because of Aristotle's faulty sense of geography as his tutor. From Robin Lane Fox, The Classical World. p203 He [Aristotle] had some role, surely, in the continuing curiosity of Alexander about the Asia which he was conquering, but his main role appears to be in passing on his awful sense of geography. Aristotle believed that the edge of the world was visible from what we call the Hindu Kush moun— tains in Afghanistan: like many, Aristotle confused them with the distant Caucasus. He also reasoned that the river Indus ran neatly round to Egypt and that modern Morocco is quite close to India, on the grounds that both lands have elephants. This view of the world can only have strength- ened the young Alexander’s resolve to conquer to the edge of it. How plausible is this view? ]"

"The really surprising thing about the mutiny on the Hydaspes River is how long it took to happen. In other words how long Alexander marched his men through hell before they finally had their bellies full of it The Macedonian army had accomplished things that no other army would ever do again, and even its last battle against Pontus was a victory, But the men in that army had campaigned for most of their lives and a lot of them simply wanted to be done with the part of their lives where they could be called on to kill people every day. They wanted to take their pay and find a life for themselves while they still had a few years left to enjoy it. To that end, completing the conquest of Persia made sense to these men, so that that threat couldn't rise again. War against whole new empires should be the job of a new generation of younger men who were not already worn thin by decades of war. They had seen enough and were ready to end their watch with honor. So when Alexander tried to begin a whole new war against Pontus, without rotating any of his men home first, it's not surprising his veterans finally lost patience and told him, in no uncertain terms, it is enough. The greater surprise is that they'd held on as long as they had, longer than any other army fighting under any other king. Very few kings could have held tat army as together as long as Alexander, long enough to conquer the entirety of the world's largest empire in a single lifetime. The next closest achievement I can think of in recorded history is the Caesarian conquest of Gaul, and Caesar had far more mutiny problems in those campaigns.","[24&&boringhistoryfan&& Just to clarify, I think you mean Porus?

"I was going to make a separate post about this, that the reason for Alexander's continued push to India was because of Aristotle's faulty sense of geography as his tutor. From Robin Lane Fox, The Classical World. p203 He [Aristotle] had some role, surely, in the continuing curiosity of Alexander about the Asia which he was conquering, but his main role appears to be in passing on his awful sense of geography. Aristotle believed that the edge of the world was visible from what we call the Hindu Kush moun— tains in Afghanistan: like many, Aristotle confused them with the distant Caucasus. He also reasoned that the river Indus ran neatly round to Egypt and that modern Morocco is quite close to India, on the grounds that both lands have elephants. This view of the world can only have strength- ened the young Alexander’s resolve to conquer to the edge of it. How plausible is this view?",[3&&James-K-Polka&& We’ve all been there in Civilization.

"I once came across a theory, possibly a conspiracy theory even, that there was no mutiny. Or not much of one. That Alex was only ever interested in conquering Darius' kingdom, and thus the extent of his conquests. And establishing buffer states subordinate but nominally independent just beyond that.

Too much evidence that Alexander was incapable of looking at unconquered territory without trying to figure out how to conquer it. The man was simply much too unused to failure to actually be willing to settle. He would swing his sword until it broke. It broke at the Hydaspes. One of the things to bear in mind is that Alexander had already had to reinspire his men several times to get them across the mountains and valleys of central Asia, and his men had already sacrificed an incredible amount for him before their patience finally failed and they demanded release from service. Alexander did everything he did off the backs of his veterans, when those backs finally broke he knew that it was, at the very least, time to fall back, consolidate, and reforge a new army. His bottomless treasuries of luck and chaisma were finally run dry and it was time to retool, rearm, and prepare for future campaigns that are definitely going to hhappen just as soon as he gets over that nagging cough of his. ]"

Maybe it suited people to present it that way?"" That is absolutely part of it, and I wouldn't even call it a conspiracy theory. All of what we know about Alexander's campaign has been heavily mythologized. There's a narrative element to all of it. Like, yes, of course Alexander really existed and of course the Macedonians conquered Persia - but ""Alexander the Great"" has also been turned into a story (likely already when it was happening). And you can tell, because ""The Macedonian soldiers grumble but Alexander convinces them to push on"" is a recurring theme. This happens dozens of times throughout the war, and every time Alexander's bravery and charisma makes the soldiers rally behind him. After the mutiny at the Hyphasis the Macedonians are again convinced by Alexander to fight on. Not into India proper, fair enough, but they turn south and fight several wars against native kingdoms, with some of the fiercest battles of the entire campaign. Not just to get through as fast as possible, but actually besieging cities, establishing client states, etc. That's not the behaviour of an army that mutinied to go home, right? And to make clear how much of a recurring theme the mutiny is: during one of those battles we again get a story where the soldiers are unable to scale the enemy walls, and would prefer to wait it out and besiege the enemy (again: is that the behaviour of an army desperate to go home?), so Alexander grabs a ladder and climbs the walls himself, coaxing his soldiers into following him and taking the city. Alexander gets injured in the fight. And that's part of Alexander's appeal. It's part of his image. The charismatic, brash, hands-on, ambitious leader who fights with his soldiers on the frontlines, who is always more brave and more cocky than the others. Alexander not being willing to give up is part of his story. The soldiers being reluctant to do it is also part of his story. Their reluctance makes Alex seem more brave. We have similar stories before each of the three big battles against the Persians (Granicus, Issus, Gaugamela). For all three there is a story that Alexander's generals advised him caution. ""Don't fight the Persians, Alex,"" they said. ""Be more cautious. Take it slow,"" and then Alex says: ""Nope, we're attacking"" and he wins. Even in the battles themselves this is always the narrative. The Macedonians are outnumbered and outbattled, pushed on the flanks, the lines are about to crumble... and there goes Alexander! Riding straight into enemy lines, heading for the enemy leader and bam! The enemy is routing. Alexander has been story-fied into an always brave, always ambitious, always brash leader that never took no for an answer and always wanted to push on. Largely, that will have been true - but any situation in which it wasn't true will have been shaped to fit that narrative, too. Some of that was consciously done by Alexander himself: he explicitly styled himself after Achilles (and calling Hephaestion his Patroklos). Other narratives came about through historicians looking for patterns: the battle of the Persian Gate was eerily similar of Thermopylae (with the roles reversed) so of course Greek historicians came up with the idea that Alexander was helped by a local shepherd to encircle the enemy. No matter how truthful it is, ""Alexander wants to push into India but the soldiers want to go home"" fits the narrative really, really well. ]"

And as it’s summer and vacation I entertained myself with Herman Paul’s Key issues in historical theory and especially his chapter about a moral relationship with the past where he discusses the art of a historical conversation with the past. And I was thinking - racism is a topic where morality often comes in to play (and it was for a time the only bearing argument against slavery). And - no wonder. I - as I assume many other - do react strongly on events in the past and how people was treated, racism today - and the history of the past. And the explanations of racism are among both authors a lot about structures and continuity. And we look a lot about the scientific explanations and theories about the meaning or skin colour and for many in the public the culturalism is much less acknowledged today when it comes to being rooted in racism. So my question would be - How do we know that we ask the right questions to the past in regards to racism and - what questions are we not asking as racism still holds a right grip about our societies? Is there an elephant in the room ? Is there another kind of relation to the past we should approach on these topics ? An epistemic? ]"

Most numbers are hugely inflated by contemporary authors, and modern historians have tried to make more realistic estimates.

Medieval states were the offshoot of the Germanic successors to the Western Roman empire. They had different goals, which required different forms of organization. Primarily, they were looking for land, which subsequently was how they rewarded their followers, creating what we call a land-based state. Rome, on the other hand, had been a fiscal-based state. The shift from one to the other was also self-reinforcing: no need to field large armies when your opponents do neather (this is also why the Late Roman army was forced to divide itself into ever smaller operational units). Also, local Roman elites were more than happy to make common cause with the new Germanic warlords since they demanded so little in return. The tax pressure of the Roman world wasn't attained again until well into the 17th century. Different goals required different means. Consequently, when the 'state' began to reassert itself from the Late Medieval era onward, it saw a growth of the machinery of government and a return of the need to garner more taxation.

When did number figures start becoming accurate?,"[4&&Thibaudborny&& Late Medieval and Early Modern Era when we have more and more surviving historical documents of the administrative side of military campaigns. Before as well, just more sporadic, the availability of administrative documents is generally scarce but tells a more lucid story than, for example, chroniclers would. Point in case are the Crusades. We have a hard time making estimates of how many people took part in them, particularly the early ones, and written accounts are particularly unhelpful because the human eye can't really accurately grasp crowds and by design, such sourches were meant to create effect. So sources like Anna Comnena, the Gesta Francorum, and others will write about how the men were 'as numerous as the stars, as the grains, as the sand', etc and then slap a number of a few hundred thousands here and there on it. It was all very nice phrasing but quite useless from a scientific point of view. However, as crusading developed, the machinery became more elaborate, and thus also the administrative footprint. The naval route also gained traction, and this has been a treasure trove for historians. Ships are limited in space, and their cargoes were well documented by those offering them for service. Hence, we get very detailed lists from participants later on based on their means of transport. The overall development of warfare towards the end of the medieval era also helped here. In the context of the Hundred Year War (1337-1453), we see in England the growth of what we call ""bastard feudalism"". In short, the king would no longer organize his armies by means of traditional levies but would make contracts with lords to provide him x amount of men for a period of time. These documents allow us to put together the numbers of Henry V's army when it crossed to the continent. As said, such forms of documentation existed before, it is just that little survived the test of time. When classic authors tell us a Roman consul campaigned with a traditional consular army of 2 legions + 2 auxiliary legions, we have a fair grasp that the Roman army was around 20-25.000 men. Yet they aren't always so forthcoming, particularly later when the armies became more standardized and worked through more ingenious ways. One feature of the standing Roman army from the Principate onwards was that armies were permanent, but this meant that the legions were continuously shuffled around as campaigns dictated. All in all, by using the number of legions involved, one can form an idea, but the Romans also used vexillationes, meaning a form of detachments (since they couldn't just pull out any legion from their garrison, as that would weaken the borders). In terms of numbers, these varied but estimates are thry generally counted for 1000 men + 500 cavalry. But you can see how it becomes a puzzle, all the more when authors may be scarce with references or make faulty ones. So while we have a good idea of the successful Armenian and Parthian campaigns of Corbulo (58-63) under Nero, we have a hard time figuring out the exact size of his army. So long story short - narrative accounts tend to often muddle matters, but for a modern historian, getting access to the proverbial red tape surrounding such affairs is a treasure trove. ]"

But on the other hand, if the armistice negotiations hadn't been so drawn out, the Allies might have been able to strike before the Germans cemented their grip on Italy. Another aspect was post-war concerns about the future of Italy. After WWI, the Italians left had grown in strength until crushed by the alliance between the government and the fascist blackshirts. If there was a repeat of this after WWII, I think the (Western) Allies preferred to be in control of Italy rather than having it come under control of a communist government. ]"

He gets into the difference in treatment by the different branches, the hostility of southerners and their willingness to attack US troops solely b/c of their color and hostility to Black Americans who were working in the war industry, like the Mobile riots. But he also talks about the successes, like the Double V campaign, the creation of leadership fostered by the war that led the civil rights movement to their successes in the 1950s and 60s, Bayard Rustin's promise and executive order from FDR for opening up war jobs to Black Americans. The other book that is especially pertinent is By Hands Now Known. It gets into incidents of lynching and how they were covered up. A common thread is bus drivers killing US Servicemen b/c they were black. You can hear an interview with the author here: http://libwww.freelibrary.org/podcast/episode/2182 Color of Law is a good introduction to redlining. It gets into things like redlining and has important statistics about how the GI Bill was closed off to Black Americans in the south. It also gets to issues about housing during the war. Portland, Oregon provides an interesting example. Portland was fairly racist but had a small AA population, so most of the racism was aimed at the Asian, mostly Japanese descent, population and Jewish people, with some protestant prejudice for the state's Irish and Italian immigrants and Catholicism. During the war ship building boomed and the Kaiser Shipyards built a city called Vanport north of Portland. Although Oregon had no housing segregation outside of custom, the war department demanded that the housing in Vanport be segregated and only funded segregated facilities. There's a big entry on Vanport in the Oregon Encyclopedia: https://www.oregonencyclopedia.org/articles/vanport/ But the TLDR is basically that the benefits of mortgage programs and the GI Bill were left to the state to administer, so they didn't Black Americans much good b/c redlining and local practice closed off mortgages, and college funding isn't much help if all the colleges don't admit Black students. And here's Richard Rothstein giving a talk on his book, Color of Law: https://youtu.be/r9UqnQC7jY4 Before 1968 the primary way that Black Americans had to buy a house was through a land sale contract. Mortgages generally weren't available to Black Americans b/c of the variety of way segregation worked, federal law, and banking policy. Ta-Nehisi Coates's famous piece in the Atlantic on reparations gets into how these contracts worked. https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/06/the-case-for-reparations/361631/ The question of the gap between White and Black wealth at the time is a little tricky. It was decreasing, but that was largely b/c Black Americans were relocating out of subsistence level farming in the south and into more modern jobs. They were basically entering the modern economy, so their relative to position was improving, but if you look at job classes or geographic comparisons there were still significant gaps between White and Black workers. Black workers were frequently excluded from union jobs, they weren't eligible for mortgages, their schools were almost always substandard to White schools (Chicago famously had overcrowded schools on the south side after the war and class was reduced to half day. At the same time they had under attended schools in white neighborhoods and would not let Black students transfer or enroll at those schools. This was one of the big issues during MLK's ill-fated Northern Campaign.) Robert Putnam had a book, The Upswing, not that long ago that touched on this issue that gap seems to have stagnated after most of the immigration out of the south to the north or west had ended. https://youtu.be/pfOH5xKNYeE ]"
"African-Americans were treated awfully during WWII as the military was still segregated and even during the war there were still lots of African-Americans getting lynched stateside. Jim Crow was still very much enforced then and afterwards. “This Nonviolent Stuff’ll Get You Killed” by Charles E. Cobb Jr. is a good read to understand how Black Veterans interacted with Civil Rights. African-Americans weren’t thriving by any means, but there were some communities that were starting to do well. Often those communities were destroyed or trashed regularly. Racists couldn’t stand to see success. Red lining was a huge problem, and even now there is a bunch of red lining to the detriment of minorities. A lot of Black Americans were able to buy housing, but a lot weren’t able to get more than government housing. Those that were able to buy housing often couldn’t get any in desirable neighborhoods, which is where red lining and white flight comes in.","[1&&AverygreatSpoon&& Thanks for the insight!

Consider how long slavery lasted, so no opportunity to build wealth at that point. Then the Civil War happens and the slaves are seemingly free. But the amendment meant to free them contains a loophole that allows prisoners to be used as slaves, so then you get Jim Crow and sharecroppers that force you to effectively be serfs. Can’t build wealth very effectively. So you do your best to free yourself by leaving your parents farm. Eventually you and some like-minded individuals form a community in a city. You eventually start to do well despite the death threats and killings of your people. Then something like the Tulsa Massacre in 1921 begins to happen in other communities around the country, and you’re not allowed to progress as a community past a certain point, and that’s enforced by your oppressors. That’s a snapshot. Even if small numbers were doing better than most that’s not progress. If you’re working in a coal mine in West Virginia or on an oil patch in Texas and you’re making multiple dollars less than your coworkers you’re not thriving. Just because you weren’t a chattel slave anymore doesn’t mean you’re automatically thriving. ]"

"I have recently been reading Roediger and Fredeicksona takes on racism. And as it’s summer and vacation I entertained myself with Herman Paul’s Key issues in historical theory and especially his chapter about a moral relationship with the past where he discusses the art of a historical conversation with the past. And I was thinking - racism is a topic where morality often comes in to play (and it was for a time the only bearing argument against slavery). And - no wonder. I - as I assume many other - do react strongly on events in the past and how people was treated, racism today - and the history of the past. And the explanations of racism are among both authors a lot about structures and continuity. And we look a lot about the scientific explanations and theories about the meaning or skin colour and for many in the public the culturalism is much less acknowledged today when it comes to being rooted in racism. So my question would be - How do we know that we ask the right questions to the past in regards to racism and - what questions are we not asking as racism still holds a right grip about our societies? Is there an elephant in the room ? Is there another kind of relation to the past we should approach on these topics ?

Did the confederates (rebels) support self governing states? Or was it the union?,"[5&&shantipole&& Assuming you're asking about the US Civil War, the Southern states were opposed to the idea of the Federal government being able to force them to do something they didn't want to that wasn't explicitly empowered in the Constitution. That something was largely stopping slavery, but you wouldn't be wrong pointing out that the commercial farming, agrarian South had very different policy priorities than the industrial- and trade-focused North and that those policy differences were longstanding and not limited to slavery (e.g. the importance of a Navy, or the national bank). Even so, slavery was the dominant point of disagreement, and the fact that the South was losing its ability to block legislation or a Constitutional amendment prohibiting it because the rest of the country was growing faster is (I would argue) the true cause of the Civil War. Within a generation or two, the South would have lost at the ballot box, so secession and war now was their only path to victory (as they saw it). Coming back to your question, the South did not want self-governing states. They wanted a weaker Federal government with state sovereignty being paramount--VERY simply they wanted States to have a veto on Federal actions that affected them. The North wanted at least a strong-enough-to-be-effective Federal government, even if that caused a little diminution of power of the States. ]"
Did the confederates (rebels) support self governing states? Or was it the union?,"[5&&elmonoenano&& Not really. They supported a confederacy, which was looser than a federal system, up until the point in the war when it was clear it wouldn't work. Then supported a more and more centralized system until the confederacy completely collapsed. Most of the ""state's rights"" rhetoric was a post war justification. The southern states had no problem using federal power right up until they couldn't anymore b/c Lincoln was president. They happily trampled on state's rights with their control of the judiciary, with the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, with their opposition to ideas like the Wilmont Proviso and Popular Sovereignty and reneging on the compromise of 1850. ]"
Did Japan really surrender cause of the atomic bombs in world war 2 or was it cause Russia invade Manchuria? Or was it combination of both?,"[7&&shantipole&& That's a mighty big can of worms you're opening. You really will need to read a history of World War 2 to get a true answer. For a short answer, the Japanese strategy depended on the assumption that the US/the Allies would prefer to negotiate and let the Japanese keep some or all of their gains instead of engaging in a costly, protracted war. If the Japanese could increase the cost of fighting them or the opponent was otherwise occupied (with Germany, for one example), so much the better. To a large extent, Pearl Harbor was part and parcel of this strategy...destroy the US's ability to effectively fight back (until they rebuilt) to make negotiating even more attractive and extract more concessions. The Pacific campaign is, basically, everything it took to disabuse Japanese leadership of that assumption. It took a lot. The Soviet invasion plus the atomic bombs both were necessary, not least because both showed that there was no hope of a negotiated peace. And Japan had the undivided attention of the US and USSR, plus Britain, etc. now that Germany had surrendered. ]"
Did Japan really surrender cause of the atomic bombs in world war 2 or was it cause Russia invade Manchuria? Or was it combination of both?,"[6&&elmonoenano&& This comes up a lot and there's several good answers on r/askhistorians, but it's a combination of those things and the accumulation of several others. Japan was just devastated. Their merchant fleet was destroyed. They had no operational navy. The US could bomb them at will. They were facing starvation. Their best troops had already been lost, basically the only remaining effective army was in Manchuria and they were about to be completely overrun by Japan's only plan for a negotiated surrender. Then the nuclear bombs fell and Japan believed the US could basically destroy the entirety of Honshu without ever setting a single soldier's boot on the ground. But the US and its allies were also in a position to use almost 2 million troops in the invasion. The naval invasion fleet was planned to have 42 aircraft carrier. (Think about that if you're a Japanese planner at this point. The US fleet and its allies dwarfed, after 4 years of war, the IJN at the height of it's power. The US alone had built as many ships as were in the IJN at the beginning of the war in 1944 and were on track to do it again in 1945.) Japan's last hope was to sue for peace and use the USSR as mediators to negotiate a peace. Sometimes you'll see people argue that the US didn't need to use nuclear weapons b/c Japan were willing to surrender. They're usually referring to this plan to negotiate. But that plan was never viable b/c the USSR wasn't going to be a neutral mediator. After Potsdam the USSR was committed to invading Manchuria. There were still a few die hard holdouts in like Hatanaka, but as their failed coup attempt shows, they didn't really have much support outside of their clique of jr. officers. All this stuff happened in a fairly short time, nukes on Aug 5 and 9, USSR invasion of Manchuria on Aug 8, surrender on Aug 15, and attempted coup on Aug 12-15, happened close enough together that that causes some confusion too. Some other confusion surrounds the actual surrender. The emperor's address didn't actually say they surrendered. It said something along the lines that the government had accepted the Potsdam Declaration, and it used very formal legalistic language. So a lot of people in Japan and its armed forces didn't immediately know Japan had surrendered. The confusion around that, the coup, and just the rapid pace of events in the week before the surrender create enough muddle that people, if they're willing to be selective in their facts, can make a pretty good case for almost anything. But a war, especially one on the scale of WWII can never be boiled down to one or two events. It's a growing accumulation of conditions and decisions and responses.

You have to keep in mind that most of Scotland does not have a Celtic language as a native languages for over 1000 years. The native language in most of the south of Scotland has been Scots, a sister language of English, for a very long time.

Even before D-Day, USA fought Germans in Northern Africa and invaded Sicily and Italy, leading to fall of Mussolini. The gridlock in the north of Italy lead to opening a front in France and landing in Normandy. Before USA entered the war, they were supplying all other allied nations with immense amount of stuff required for the war to continue.

They're not the same. They gave 30 million lives to defeat them, the USA only gave less than a half million. This only follows if it was a competition to see who could sacrifice the most men. This is also incorporating Soviet civilian losses into the number; surely you aren't suggesting the USSR knowingly used civilians? Also, D-Day was over 3 years after Pearl Harbor The Germans famously did not attack Pearl Harbor. which makes me think, that we waited for the Russians to beat the Germans The Germans were not beaten at D-Day. You'll note that at the end of the war, the Allies had entered Germany from both the west and east against fierce resistance. and it seems USA had a much smaller role in the War then I had always thought. The USA relentlessly mythologises its past in a way most countries do not, but they did send an enormous amount of materiel to other allied countries, including the USSR, without which fighting the war would have been much more difficult. Their industry was second to none, and they provided a non-stop flow of food, weapons, vehicles, tanks, and aircraft, as well as fighting a war on two fronts, across two oceans. No other country did that. The Soviets took an enormous amount of casualties for a lot of reasons, not least of them the size and intensity of the front they were fighting on, but this isn't a competition to see who can get the most people killed. A good amount of those men were taken prisoner by the Germans and then starved to death. Their casualties are also partially due to Soviet mismanagement, and sometimes, brutal ignorance or lack of care on the part of their command.

Also, even looking at the military casualties, those numbers are misleading. Stalin purged the officer corps shortly before the German invasion (again! There had been purges in the late 30s, too) of suspected disloyal officers--a Soviet Army with more experienced leadership and less wondering if they'd survive thr next chat with the Commisar probably would have lost many fewer men accomplishing the same objectives. In addition, the argument that the USSR really won the war and the other Allies coasted on Soviet blood is Cold War propaganda. In reality, the US and UK more than pulled their weight. The US/UK beat the Axis in North Africa and Italy and performed the vast majority of the blockade and the strategic bombing that crippled German industry and warfighting capability--they didn't just sit around watching newsreels during the 2.5 years between Pearl Harbor and D Day. The US also provided an overwhelming amount of material aid to the USSR basically for free and the Allies devoted escorts, including battleships (mostly UK ships), to make sure supplies got to Archangel. Kruschev said that Stalin himself admitted (in private, of course) that the USSR could not have won without US aid. The US and UK also defeated the Japanese in the Pacific; the USSR didn't even declare war on Japan until after the Hiroshima atomic bomb had dropped. Regardless of the propaganda, the other Allies did an enormous amount to win the war and the USSR couldn't have done its share without the other Allies expending a lot of resources and lives. ]"

Below is my original post: Best history documentaries/docuseries in chronological order?I'm a fan of documentaries/docuseries and would like to brush up on my history as it's an area I'm severely lacking in. I've searched for 'best history documentaries' and a few pop up often, such as Ken Burns' Civil War. I've also heard Dan Carlin's 'Hardcore History' podcast is a great option - I'm not against it but I would prefer something I could watch. I'd entertain books as well if considered a 'must read'.What I'm interested in is going back as far as possible into history and working my way to current events.While I'm sure most of you might not consider this history per se, I was thinking of starting with Graham Hancock's 'Ancient Apocalypse' just to get perspective from where we might have come from and then work my way forward. I also wouldn't mind going back further and dive into earth's creation (or further still).I'm completely open to any suggestions and wouldn't mind watching several documentaries/docuseries of the same time period or subject.Looking forward to your suggestions. ]"

The filmmakers had to contend with some cooing pigeons in the warehouse and had to continuously scare the birds before each shot. The film, once completed, needed to pass the Mexican governments film censors who owned CONACINE, Mexico's state run movie production company, who owned all the film, and who was in charge of distribution and dissemination once released. Rojo Amanecer was eventually released, but if you watch the film you'll notice there's no reference or visual imagery depicting the Mexican military.

So here it goes: TLDR: I am looking for suggested reading covering the Soviet's in the area between the outbreak of WWI until the end of WWII. The last year or so I have become more and more interested in history. It really all started with finding an old edition of ""The Rise and fall of the Third Reich"" at my mothers place. I found myself very fascinated with the book, sparkling an interest in the years before and during WWII. As a reference I have been reading books from historians like Ian Kershaw ( ""The End"", ""Hitler"" ), but also fiction - like ""All quiet on the Western Front"". While I probably could keep on reading (and probably will) about the German society in that area, I am looking for something covering topics from a Soviet viewpoint. Preferably something similar to Kershaw's works. I find them an easy read - while he still (as I understand it) is very reputable and is well regarded. So - can anyone recommend some works covering Russian/ Soviet affairs regarding the area from, between and during WWI and WW2? Anything from Stalin biographies, the 1917 revolution, maybe something with focus on the Soviets WWII history? Preferably works by reputable historians that are also accessible by a layman. As mentioned, fiction can also be an alternative (a la ""All quiet on the Western Front""), but I generally find Russian literature a bit rough reading after a couple of attempts at Dostojevskij. Thanks in advance. ]"

So, I heard somewhere (I think an episode of Hardcore history) that these armor sets cost an astronomical amount of time and money to produce; something like a single helmet was multiple weeks worth of wage. I also had the concept in my head that the idea of ""the State handing out and equipping its soldiery"" was pretty far down the line in terms of world history - like ""uniforms"" for a cohort of troops dont exist yet right? So my question is how did those first heavy cav. units equip themselves and who paid for it? Are those guys exclusively wealthy or the sons of wealthy people? Thanks (This all started because I was trying to figure out what a pretorian wore, saw the whole no uniform thing and am at the part in A Histroy of Rome by Mike Duncan where diocletian is fighting the cataphracts). ]"

"Apparently I can't make a new post here, and to be honest, this might be more fitting here. So here it goes: TLDR: I am looking for suggested reading covering the Soviet's in the area between the outbreak of WWI until the end of WWII. The last year or so I have become more and more interested in history. It really all started with finding an old edition of ""The Rise and fall of the Third Reich"" at my mothers place. I found myself very fascinated with the book, sparkling an interest in the years before and during WWII. As a reference I have been reading books from historians like Ian Kershaw ( ""The End"", ""Hitler"" ), but also fiction - like ""All quiet on the Western Front"". While I probably could keep on reading (and probably will) about the German society in that area, I am looking for something covering topics from a Soviet viewpoint. Preferably something similar to Kershaw's works. I find them an easy read - while he still (as I understand it) is very reputable and is well regarded. So - can anyone recommend some works covering Russian/ Soviet affairs regarding the area from, between and during WWI and WW2? Anything from Stalin biographies, the 1917 revolution, maybe something with focus on the Soviets WWII history? Preferably works by reputable historians that are also accessible by a layman. As mentioned, fiction can also be an alternative (a la ""All quiet on the Western Front""), but I generally find Russian literature a bit rough reading after a couple of attempts at Dostojevskij.

The exploits of the East India Company didn’t end in India. In one of its darkest chapters, the Company smuggled opium into China in exchange for the country’s most prized trade good: tea. China only traded tea for silver, but that was hard to come by in England, so the Company flouted China’s opium ban through a black market of Indian opium growers and smugglers. As tea flowed into London, the Company’s investors grew rich and millions of Chinese men wasted away in opium dens. When China cracked down on the opium trade, the British government sent warships, triggering the Opium War of 1840. The humiliating Chinese defeat handed the British control of Hong Kong, but the conflict shed further light on the East India Company’s dark dealings in the name of profit. Source: History.com ]"

She then lived in West Berlin, and eventually married an American soldier and moved to the USA. She is very open to talking to me about it all. It’s so fascinating. My question is: should I ask her permission to record what she says? There aren’t many WWII survivors left, and especially not many who were in her situation. Are there professionals who could come and document her experiences? She is very elderly and I don’t want her experiences to disappear if she were to pass. Thoughts?","[2&&Extra_Mechanic_2750&& By all means ask her but think about what you are going to say, what you are going to do with the information, why you want to record it and please make sure that you have a safe archive for the media. Also, I would suggest that you read up on best practices for structuring an oral history recording session. The Smithsonian has some here https://siarchives.si.edu/history/how-do-oral-history as does the Library of Congress: https://loc.gov/folklife/familyfolklife/oralhistory.html I would also recommend that you watch as many oral history sessions as you can so you can get a sense of what works and what doesn't. My personal take on doing these: Don't do a question and answer session, it should be more of a conversation. Be organized and have a goal but don't be so rigid that you don't explore the branches as they present themselves. Don't be wishy-washy all over the place. Pay close attention to your subject, their body language, their tone and be sensitive to their feelings vs what you want. Get some editorial help when you condense it down but keep all the original unedited media. ]"

There's a few people who claimed to be him (Pseudo-Nero). There's also a number of imposters (pretenders) in general who claimed to be long-lost sons or people who died and tried to lead rebellions or make claims to thrones, with varying levels of success. Andriscus is one of the more famous ones that comes to mind, who claimed he was the son of Perseus of Macedon, the last (official) king of Macedon. Most people don't seem to have believed this theory though, and he largely used mercenaries and some Macedonians that were just happy to have anyone ready to fight off Rome. But his revolt was eventually put down and he was killed. Lots of conspiracies about conspiring with the enemy. This was a big one in ancient Greek politics and often the background for exile and later ostracism. Themistocles rose to power through the use of ostracism taking away his opposition, claiming they were siding with the Persians. While there's no definite proof that Themistocles was behind these accusations, it's generally agreed that he played a role since he's the one that benefited from them, and when the people returned they very quickly turned on him -- there was clearly some bad blood. You also get cases like Pausanias, a Spartan regent, who was said to have been conspiring with the Persians and was killed. But looking at the whole era it's hard to take all of these accusations as absolute fact. Though, funnily enough, Themistocles ended up going to the Persians for safety. And you also have people like Alcibiades who ended up with the Persians, and with the Spartans, both enemies of his hometown of Athens at that point. However, the defection to Sparta seems to have been heavily based on conspiracy theories and a kangaroo court against him, centered around the mimicry of the Eleusinian Mysteries and an event where a gang of men chopped off the penises of Herm statues in Athens, leading to a lot of accusations and discussions of domestic terrorism and just a bad period in Athens' political history. His departure from Sparta is a bit less clear, but he seems to have upset his host, with some belief that this may have been because of an affair. In short: a lot of conspiracies were tied together with politics, rivalries, etc. You really only needed to convince others of these things, and if you could swing the populace to support your claims you could greatly benefit. ]"

"Hi Yall - I have a question regarding the armor that troops like the cataphracts or the early proto-knights.

I also had the concept in my head that the idea of ""the State handing out and equipping its soldiery"" was pretty far down the line in terms of world history It depends on which set of cataphracts you mean. In western terms, the first cataphracts were Roman, and were equipped by the state. Their equipment was fairly standardised, and the men were professional soldiers. This is different from the later Byzantine (Roman, but under a different name) cataphracts, who were largely middle class men who provided their own equipment, it just had to be up to a certain standard. The theme system meant that the empire could call upon men who could support their own efforts in the field, without burdening the state. like ""uniforms"" for a cohort of troops dont exist yet right? It depends. This comes and goes, but increases in ocurrence as time goes on, as forces become more centralised and standardised.

"Where did the, I guess, notion of Last names happen? During the Ancient time did everyone simply have first names, and that was it?","[4&&MeatballDom&& Good question. So first with ancient times: it's going to depend when and where. For places like Greece people were generally only referred to with one name, but for clarity ancient historians would refer to someone as (First Name) Of (their father's name) and sometimes additional details like where they were from. Names tended to be reused within certain families as well, so this also helped to narrow things down but it wasn't entirely clear all the time and there's definitely some confusion on some figures and whether they were the same person or someone else. Thankfully, we do have things like the New Pauly which can list all the important figures with the same name and can help narrow it down or provide best guesses. With Rome there was also a lot of familial names, but there was a lot more specificity. A typical Roman had three names, a personal name, a family name, and a further personal name. It gets more complicated than that, so I'd just recommend reading this if you're keen https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_naming_conventions#Tria_nomina But Julius Caesar was named Gaius (also written Caius) Julius (Iulius) Caesar (but it's also more complicated than that https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Julius_Caesar_(name) ) So we've got fathers, we've got families, and then you also see things like occupation. Smith, a blacksmith; Farmer, is a farmer; Miller worked at the mills. ""I need to speak with John"" ""Which John?"" ""John the Smith"" titles evolved into descriptors and descriptors evolved into names. It also helped that many people taught their children their craft and businesses remained in the family. So you might have a line of smiths and your family just becomes the Smith(s). Very simple explanation, like I've hinted at it is more complicated, but hopefully this can give you a platform to launch into more research. ]"

There's two areas where you might possibly argue for continuity. One would obviously be the Catholic Church. It was a rather integral part of the Roman Empire towards the end and there might be continuous lines for some bishopric beside the papacy itself. Also, I wouldn't be surprised if you could find some amount of continuity in local government in the big cities of the empire.

"I have always wondered about the discovery of different continents, what is the best you can tell about how each continent was technically discovered? This may seem like a complex question but I came up with it simply from Christopher Columbus’s exploration to the Americas in 1492. I then thought, how did Australia get discovered? Hawaii?

Australia is hard to nail down perfectly, but it probably was settled around 60,000 years ago. This date shifts and fluctuates as new evidence comes to light, but we'll almost certainly never have an exact time with an exact journey. This is a very long period of time, so you can understand that the world did not look the same back then. Back then Australia was much closer to Indonesia, though some debate on how close, but this was mainly because of sea level changes. How much was crossed through land bridges and how much was crossed by sea is debated, but generally people are coming down from South East Asia and slowly spreading into what we now call Australia. https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/Map_of_Sunda_and_Sahul.svg Hawaii was part of the Polynesian civilisation. They also came from Asia, and spread out (though seem to have missed Australia) but went as far west as Madagascar, and as far east as Easter Island (Rapa Nui) and POSSIBLY South America but I think the current evidence for this is highly overstated, but there's definitely something going on there and we're on the right track to figuring out what/how/when/where. So back to Hawaii specifically, the Polynesians spread out through the use of double hulled canoe catamarans, and settled islands throughout the Pacific. It wasn't one big wave, but generational settlements to different areas in different directions, with some trade continuing, and others falling into isolation. This should give you a sense of the flow of things https://teara.govt.nz/files/1449-enz.jpg Like Australia, we don't have a distinct date, but it's looking likely that they came to the island sometime in the early 2nd millennium CE. There are founding myths, but take them with a grain of salt. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawai%CA%BBiloa Antarctica has no evidence for human exploration before naval explorations in the 1800s, with von Bellingshausen spotting it in 1820 and doing a more detailed expedition around it in 1821. Funnily enough, in 1820, just a few days after Bellingshausen spotted it, master Bransfield spotted it as well, but didn't know he was a few days late until later.

"What's the longest period in history that is ""void"" by people trying to destroy historical records to cover up the truth 'cos ""only winners write history""? Is there forbidden history knowledge? In the past there were some eras when scholars were hunted.","[7&&AutoModerator&& Hi! It seems like you are talking about the popular but ultimately flawed and false ""winners write history"" trope! While the expression is sometimes true in one sense (we'll get to that in a bit), it is rarely if ever an absolute truth, and particularly not in the way that the concept has found itself commonly expressed in popular history discourse. When discussing history, and why some events have found their way into the history books when others have not, simply dismissing those events as the imposed narrative of 'victors' actually harms our ability to understand history. You could say that is in fact a somewhat ""lazy"" way to introduce the concept of bias which this is ultimately about. Because whoever writes history is the one introducing their biases to history. A somewhat better, but absolutely not perfect, approach that works better than 'winners writing history' is to say 'writers write history'. This is more useful than it initially seems. Until fairly recently the literate were a minority, and those with enough literary training to actually write historical narratives formed an even smaller and more distinct class within that. To give a few examples, Genghis Khan must surely go down as one of the great victors in all history, but he is generally viewed quite unfavorably in practically all sources, because his conquests tended to harm the literary classes.Similarly the Norsemen historically have been portrayed as uncivilized barbarians as the people that wrote about them were the ""losers"" whose monasteries got burned down. Of course, writers are a diverse set, and so this is far from a magical solution to solving the problems of bias. The painful truth is, each source simply needs to be evaluated on its own merits.This evaluation is something that is done by historians and part of what makes history and why insights about historical events can shift over time. This is possibly best exemplified by those examples where victors did unambiguously write the historical sources. The Spanish absolutely wrote the history of the conquest of Central America from 1532, and the reports and diaries of various conquistadores and priests are still important primary documents for researchers of the period. But 'victors write the history' presupposes that we still use those histories as they intended, which is simply not the case. It both overlooks the fundamental nature of modern historical methodology, and ignores the fact that, while victors have often proven to be predominant voices, they have rarely proven to be the only voices. Archaeology, numismatics, works in translation, and other records all allow us at least some insight into the 'losers' viewpoint, as does careful analysis of the 'winner's' records.We know far more about Rome than we do about Phoenician Carthage. There is still vital research into Carthage, as its being a daily topic of conversation on this subreddit testifies to. So while it's true that the balance between the voices can be disparate that doesn't mean that the winners are the only voice or even the most interesting.Which is why stating that history is 'written by the victors' and leaving it at that is harmful to the understanding of history and the process of studying history.

Also a lot of the early history of Christianity is a mystery to us, but more because dissenting texts weren't preserved rather than outright persecution. Another example is that after the Italian fascists came to power, they raided archives to destroy documents about Mussolini in an attempt to rewrite history. So, sometimes attempts are made by states to erase the historical record, but since there hasn't been a global hegemon, they haven't been able to be completely successful. But, as Isaac Asimov points out in his review of Orwell's 1984, nobody had to alter the historical record to make Japan go from hated enemy of the US to friend and ally.

There are also a number of thinly documented societies, such as the Huns or ancient Celts, but they don't appear to have been literate in the first place, which is why they left no records. However, a practice now known as Damnatio memoriae was sometimes invoked against historical figures who thought to have done something very disgraceful and hence were to have inscriptions mentioning them and monuments dedicated to them destroyed. The Egyptians did it to the pharaoh Akhenaten. The Athenians did it to the Antigonids while they were being besieged by a Antigonid king. The Romans did it to Caligula, Nero, Domitian, Commodus, Geta, Elagabalus, and Severus Alexander, amongst others. Something similar was also done in the Soviet Union, where figures as Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Bukharin, and Rykov were retouched out of photos and removed from official accounts like the Great Soviet Encyclopedia. However, the fact that I can tell you the names of all the people who had Damnatio memoriae invoked against them proves that they were not actually fully erased. Removing a prominent person from history is a difficult endeavor. The erasure of Akhenaten came the closest to being successful, but then the ruins of his capital, Amarna, were rediscovered and excavated. ]"

Reviews copied from my Goodreads. ** Women in the Great War by Stephen Wynn and Tanya Wynn** 2/5 Writing style was dry and boring. Despite the title the book only covers British women with very little from the other powers. Most of the book is about the various volunteer and nursing organisations with not much on the home front or societal change. The chapter that does cover some of the home front - the munitions factory chapter - is mostly just a list of various munition factory accidents and explosions. The book is short at 140 pages, including a lot of photos and lists of nurses and other volunteer women who died. Overall I'd say it is difficult to recommend this book and there are probably better ones about this subject, but I haven't read any other books on this topic yet. The Shortest History of the Soviet Union Sheila Fitzpatrick 4/5 Good, short history of the Soviet Union. Lots of info considering it’s a short book. A good amount of info on demographics and the various different nationalities in the USSR. Also lots of info on life for ordinary people in the different eras of the Soviet Union. ]"

The book isn't great, but I know almost nothing about the period and if you can find this in a $3 bin, like I did, then it's probably worth it. But each subject gets about 50 pages, so it's not very in depth. I did learn a little about the Scandinavian countries at that time, what was happening in Spain and Hungary, and what a shit show the HRE was at the time. And I did enjoy it. Probably very little will stick. Basically, the big lesson I got from most of it was how bloody and long the Christianization of Europe was.

"[319&&AutoModerator&&POST=Bookclub and Sources Wednesday!] Hi everybody, Welcome to our weekly book recommendation thread! We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub. We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit.

"I've had a very hard time finding books in the economics of Nazi Germany. Specifically from the perspective of a Nazi/fascist. I really like understanding political and economic theory from the perspective of those who believe it, especially for those I already personally don't believe in. For example I'm planning on reading some Giovanni Gentile, maybe Mien Kampf, wealth of nations by Adam Smith, and Das Kapital by Karl Marx. I've found some stuff on Nazi Germany's economy from an outside perspective but it seems like there just isn't anything from the other perspective from what I've seen. If there's some out there I definitely would appreciate it if someone could point me to it. I'd prefer it to be available online in some capacity.","[5&&elmonoenano&& I think the problem you'll find is that the Nazi's didn't have a coherent economic theory. And it's not going to entirely be online. It's mostly going to be in JSTOR in lots of little articles and a then longer books b/c there's a lot of context. Hitler couldn't be bothered to learn enough about it to form anything that made sense. The party wasn't intellectually rigorous. They were opportunistic and were happy to lie, change their lie, and tell two contradicting lies at the same time. They didn't really have economic beliefs, other than simplistic ideas about an autarkic volk based economy that functioned under imaginary circumstances of racially pure pioneer farmers, war, and looting and anti-socialist. I'd start with Evans's The Third Reich in Power. I would maybe check out Joe Maiolo's Cry Havoc. You quickly realize that a lot of Nazi economics was basically just theft and redistribution. There's a book on Schacht that's not too old called Hitler's Banker. It gets into the the kind of impossible situation Schacht was put in b/c of the party's ignorance of basic financial management, corruption, and just disinterest in economic management overall. Schacht was smart enough to keep it running for years, but really he was just sort of threading the needle more than actually administering any actual financial plan based on principles or a theory. They were anti-socialist, but I think that's about all you can say for their serious economic beliefs. ]"

How did people get elected to États généraux in the late 18th century?,"[2&&phillipgoodrich&& That simple question warrants a complex and incomplete response. The Etats Generaux was quite different during the years of 1787-1795, and it became difficult even for the French to keep track of the changes, which were occurring on the fly. The traditional body was composed of three distinct ""estates:"" 1) the clergy, 2) the nobility, and 3) the common people. In that tradition, each estate carried a single vote/supervote, and insofar as the crown covered the first two estates, the common people had limited voice in the quotidien aspects of governance. The Etats Generaux was ordered to convene in 1789, the first time in 175 years! In order to decide the delegations to the various estates, a national vote was declared. Qualifications to vote varied by municipality, but was m/l any male of 25 or older, or male landowner, or male taxpayer, or male honorary or naturalized citizen. All voters voted in all three estates, but the first was limited to ordained clergy, the second to peers of the kingdom, and the third to people of ""notable"" background (no ""street people""). As the Revolution evolved, the third estate would be converted into a ""National Assembly"" by summer of 1789. At that point, the king ordered that the capital meeting place of the assembly be locked. The assembly responded by convening at a nearby tennis court, where they all swore to a ""Tennis Court Oath."" Government rapidly unraveld thereafter, and the French Revolution was on. So the answer to the question of the composition of the third estate is: popular vote by qualified voters. Parties appeared quickly and quickly rose and fell in power. The major parties evolved into the Girondists and the Montagnards. The Girondists recommended exile of all royal and noble families; the Montagnards insisted on capital trials for all. For a time the Girondists came across as a voice of reason, preceding the ""White Bolsheviks"" by 130 years, but ultimately succumbing to the Montagnards. It was a bad time for politicians in Paris. ]"
"Hello folks, I'm curious if anyone has any thoughts or can offer any parallels within Ancient History to the events with Russia/Wager Group Rebellion Thank you :)","[4&&jezreelite&& A lot of Roman and Byzantine Emperors were murdered by the Praetorian Guard or their own armies. They include Caligula, Galba, Commodus, Elagabalus, Severus Alexander, Probus, Aurelian, Tacitus, Constans, Justinian II, Leo V, and Nikephoros II Phokas. Also, though it occurred after ancient times, there was also the ignominious end of the Ayyubids in Egypt. Namely, after the defeat of the Seventh Crusade, the last Ayyubid sultan of Egypt, Al-Muazzam Turanshah, was murdered by Mamluks. They killed him because they believed he was being too arrogant and was insufficiently grateful for their help at defeating the Crusaders.

How common were women warriors in the Viking Age? Where can I learn more about this?,"[2&&jezreelite&& It's very difficult to say. One thing that's important to remember that it has been common in history for a writer who want to emphasize how different and strange another group is to talk about, ""ZOMG, they have woman warriors!"" Ancient Greeks and Romans both said this about the Scythians, Ancient Romans reported this about British and Gaulish Celts, and the Chinese (specifically in Romance of the Three Kingdoms) said that about the various peoples toward the south of them that they called the Nanman. The claims about the Scythians seems mostly true, but it's near impossible to tell about the Celts or so-called Nanman. Two examples that we know were exaggerated were the reports of Anna Komnene and Niketas Choniates of French and German women taking part in the Crusades. Sources from French and German crusaders don't tend to confirm this idea; there were women present in crusading armies, yes, but they generally did not play a big role in actual combat. Which brings us to the Norse. The only Norse woman warrior described in the sagas who definitely existed was Freydís Eiríksdóttir; she was the daughter of Erik the Red and sister or half-sister of Leif Erikson. It is questionable, however, how reliable the two sagas that mention her are and they in any case portray her very differently. She is treacherous, greedy, and murderous in The Saga of the Greenlanders, but brave, proud, and strong in The Saga of Erik the Red. But at least we know she existed, which is more than we can say for a lot of other figures in the sagas. Which brings me to the Norse female warriors Brynhild and Lagertha. Both of them may have been entirely mythical, but to be fair, the existence of of their love interests, Sigurd/Siegfried and Ragnar Lodbrok are also doubtful. It is possible that Sigurd and Brynhild might have been loosely based on the 6th century Frankish king, Sigebert I of Austrasia and the Visigoth princess, Brunhilda of Toledo (while Gunnar of Burgundy was a composite of Gundahar of Burgundy and Sigebert's brothers, Guntram of Burgundy and Chilperic of Neustria and Gudrun/Kriemhild was based on a mixture of Brunhilda, Fredegund, wife of Chillperic and Illdico, the last wife of Attila the Hun), but even if this was so, this doesn't help us establish much about female warriors: the limited sources on Brunhilda of Toledo, Fredegund, and Ildico don't mention anything of them being warriors. Ragnar, on the other hand... Well, most if his supposed sons, such as Björn Ironside, Ivar the Boneless, Ubba, Halfdan the Black, and Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye all existed, but he might have been an entirely legendary figure or he could have been loosely based on Horik I of Denmark, Reginfrid of Denmark, and/or Rognvald Eysteinsson. If his existence is dubious, then the existence of his supposed wives, Lagertha, Thora Borgarhjört, and Aslaug are even more so. Again, of his wives, only Lagertha is ever portrayed as a warrior. What's more, she is not mentioned in any of the surviving Icelandic sagas and is instead only found in Saxo-Grammaticus' work. His work contrasts majorly with the Icelandic sagas, because he has Lagertha kill Ragnar herself, but it's a crucial plot point in The Tale of Ragnar's Sons that Ragnar gets super duper murdered by Ælla of Northumbria by way of a snake pit. Unfortunately, this leaves us with more questions than answers. The Viking Age itself was not a period overwhelmingly in written sources, which is a big part of the problem. Archeological evidence is frequently ambiguous and the question of whether a woman being buried with weapons proves that she was a warrior is very difficult to answer. ]"
How common were women warriors in the Viking Age? Where can I learn more about this?,"[1&&huramazda&& Uncommon if not rare. There is no historical evidence I know of of women warriors in any ""Viking"" battles or in any ""Viking"" armies. And that's significant given how much ""Viking"" warfare is documented in sources -mostly of people who were on the receiving ed of it. One would assume that they would have noted if ""Viking"" armies contained female warriors. We do have those sources (in this case Arabs and Berbers) noting significant social role of women when their husbands were absent from home. Yet no note of female warriors. Nordic sagas do contain few stories about women warriors but it's unclear if those correspond to the reality. In any case evidence does not support it. And just to clarify, I am talking about women warriors - that is women participating as soldiers in battles, not about women owning and using weapons. Be it self defense, hunting, rituals or simply a status item. There is single burial known with female buried with weapons. Problem is that female identity is been questioned because of the possible contamination of the grave during excavation and storage for one, and for two even if that indeed was a female, presence of weapons in a grave is not an evidence of that person been automatically a warrior. Weapons had other uses then a war, some of them I had mentioned above. ]"

I finished South to Freedom by Alice Baumgartner and Jonathan White's A House Built By Slaves. The White book was a co-winner of the Lincoln Prize and I try and read those every year.

It's about Lincoln's meeting with Black Americans while he was president. There were some really interesting anecdotes that give an insight into how Lincoln was governing at the time. I thought it was a good book for exploring this facet of Lincoln and it really counters a lot of the ""actually Lincoln was racist"" stuff that gets trotted out. The Meacham biography was the other Lincoln prize winner and this did a good job of covering an area that Meacham glided over. White seems to have a disagreement with Kate Masur that was interesting to read. I really enjoyed Masur's book Until Justice Done and thought this did a good job of addressing some of her points. Neither convinced me, but I am partial to Lincoln and am more likely to see things from White's point of view. South to Freedom was interesting. Baumgartner looks at people self emancipating into Mexico. She estimates about 3K to 8K people self emancipated based on court records and runaway ads she could find. B/c New Orleans was so integrated into a Carribean economy that included cities in the Yucatan, Campeche, and Veracruz, there were more people willing to stow away and try to escape that way than I would have guessed.

I’m about to finish American Religious History by Professor Patrick N Allitt of Emory University. It’s a Great Courses lecture series and if anyone knows me you know I love me some Great Courses. It’s been really great. It’s eye-opening and informative and the lecturer does a great job of keeping it engaging. The course explores religious life in America from the first European contacts to the late 20th century. It aims to explain why America has shown so much more religious vitality than any other industrial nation and why its religions are so numerous and diverse. It considers religion not only from the point of view of beliefs, ideas, and styles of worship but also as a guide to conduct in everyday life, and it investigates the connection of religious, social, economic, and political concerns. My next physical read will be Slave Religion: The ""Invisible Institution"" in the Antebellum South by Albert J Raboteau. And if anyone has some recommendations on more specific topics in American Religious History I would love to hear them! ]"

Reviews copied and pasted from Goodreads. The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War by Peter Englund 4.5/5 rounding down for Goodreads. Very good collection of stories of individuals across the whole of WWI. The book follows the story of the same f20 people - civilian and military on both sides, across the whole war (or until they die) rather than loads of one-off stories. So you get to learn the specifics of these people like the British nurse on the Eastern Front or the German sailor becoming disillusioned by doing nothing for years on end. All of the major fronts are covered and there is at least one person for each major power (although for the Ottoman Empire the person was a South American adventurer desperate to fight in the war for any side, ended up with the Ottomans and who witnessed various atrocities, rather than a Turk). Really good at giving the feeling of the time and a mix of the mundane and the new stuff of the war. Lots of footnotes for context and extra info. While I quite liked the book and if you are interested in WWI I would say it is very good - I wouldn't recommend it as an overview of x happened then y happened, as the book is focused specifically on individuals, their stories and their perceptions of the events, including rumours and when they had wrong info. The Times First World War: The Great War from 1914 to 1918 by Peter Chasseaud 3/5 Fairly standard overview of the military history of WWI. Mostly from a top-level perspective with not much of a on the ground point of view. The political content at the beginning and end of the book is quite good for the causes and consequences of the war. There are a lot of photos and maps in the book, but all the maps are from the time and not that helpful unless you can follow military maps well. The writing style is fine but nothing special. Overall not a bad book but I wouldn't specifically seek it out unless you can find a cheap copy. Just finished July 1914: Countdown to War by Sean McMeekin 4/5 Good overview of the July Crisis and very detailed about the lead-up to WWI. Lots of context and explanations. Well written and not too dense imo. Tends to be mostly matter of fact till the end with an epilogue on the responsibility for the war, in which the author mainly blames Russia for starting to secretly mobilise before Austria-Hungary had actually declared war on Serbia. McMeekin basically says the Russian leadership mobilised, knowing what this would lead to, while the German and Austrian leadership were a bit delusional and made stupid decisions hoping/believing they could avoid a wide European war. I'd say this book fits in a good spot for WWI books - a book about the July Crisis which doesn't need too much prior knowledge and does provide a decent amount of background information. If you want the longer term causes and pre-1914 politics then go for 'Margaret MacMillans The War that Ended Peace' or 'Christopher Clark's The Sleepwalkers' instead. If you want an even more in-depth book about the July Crisis then 'T.G Otte's July Crisis: The World's Descent into War, Summer 1914' is probably better but only if you've already got a decent understanding of the politics and context of the time. ]"

As I recall, when the me-262 came into service, it was incredibly fast, and impossible to catch at altitude. As a counter to these weapons, American fighters would strike the jets on their airfields during takeoff and landing, when they were most vulnerable. What I'm trying to remember is the German response. I seem to remember them setting up base defense aircraft, whose role was to defend the jets during takeoff/landing. These were mostly bf-109s and fw-190s. And the even more dubious section of my memory recalls that they were given special color schemes, specifically bright ones, to make it obvious they weren't an allied plane. Kind of like how the allies painted invasion stripes to make identification easier. Does anyone have any info on this? Am I mis-remembering or misinterpreting real events? And if there are any examples of the base defense color schemes (if it's real), where would I find examples of them? ]"

The OT is also a history of sorts and the narrative concerning politics can be accepted, maybe not in detail, as a guide to what was happening to the Jewish people at the time. Don't rely on it for details, Moses didn't exist, but the Hebrew people may have migrated from Egypt. Solomon wasn't necessarily the man he was made out to be, but there was a temple at that time and so on. As the books come closer to our time, events and stories become more accurate and reliable, the Babylonians took all of the upper class Hebrews into exile, for example.

How does one learn more about history,"[2&&cjpr&& My experience as someone who failed academic history(because I was more interested in getting drunk and social stuff) is mostly what others have said. Find topics you like and do research. You heard a story about napoleon and he sounds cool? Read his wiki, find links to articles or books. Read those. Watch YouTube videos (loads of amazing YouTube history channels), go to your library and find history books. Hell, even historical fiction is an amazing way to get into a subject. The problem with self learning is it’s all self. You have to want to put the effort in. Sometimes that’s easy, like watching a documentary on YouTube. Sometimes it’s hard like reading a dry 600 page history book on the dynamics of 18th century French court life. To each his own. But either way, no one is going to make you do it. You have to put the effort in. I’ve learned so much since I left uni and I endlessly watch and read about history. If the passion is there, you’ll find what you’re looking for! Hope this helps!

How does one learn more about history,"[1&&elmonoenano&& You're lucky, b/c right now there's more resources for people that cater to more learning styles than ever before. I think books are hands down the best, but there are in depth podcasts, there are youtubers and documentaries, there are great websites that get in depth on specific topics (my local state's website has thousands of digitized images and articles available online so I can see interviews with Japanese involved in the interment or see pictures of Chinookan people at the turn of the 19th century or read articles on 1960s antiwar movement), things like wikipedia which give you a good jumping off point to find more things, subs like this and r/askhistorians, and communties dedicated to niches. As others have suggested the first thing is to find a topic that interests you. There are lots of specific history prizes out there. Those are good places to start looking for books b/c it means they've been reviewed by experts in the field and chosen as rising above the fray. The Pulitzer is a great place to start b/c it's general history and it swings back and for from more popular books to more academic books. The winners are all online: https://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-by-category/220 Other big prizes are the Wolfson Prize, which focuses on England: https://www.wolfsonhistoryprize.org.uk/ Gilder Lehrman prizes, which have several focuses but the Lincoln prize is my favorite: https://www.gilderlehrman.org/programs-and-events/national-book-prizes/gilder-lehrman-lincoln-prize The Cundhill prize from McGill is also very prestigious: https://www.cundillprize.com/ Most states have prizes, most niches have prizes. So google a topic your interested in and history prize and you'll probably find something. Most public libraries give you some access to JSTOR so you can download academic papers on topics that interest you. You don't have to be at the university anymore. As a starting point I'd really recommend the BBC 4 podcast, In Our Time. It's general history by very smart people with good follow up information. You're almost guaranteed to find something that really interests you in 4 or 5 episodes: https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qykl The Smithsonian and Library of Congress have tons of great stuff. PBS has a bunch of good programs out for streaming right now b/c of Juneteenth. I think Kareem Abdul Jabbar's documentary on Buffalo Soldiers is available right now.

The politics of the period are dominated with the emergence of the Labour Party and the displacement of the Liberals; the trauma of the First World War; the general strike; the economic crisis which brings about high unemployment and imperial preference tariffs as well as a national unity government; there are also complicated questions around pacifism and appeasement as Europe lurches towards war.

It's hard to imagine the leader of one of a triumvirate of the country's largest organizations disappearing, b/c there's nothing like the tirumvirate of Union leadership anymore, the SEIU and the NEA are bigger than the Teamsters. The Teamsters had over 2 million members in 1975, that was 1% of the total US population. And unions were just a bigger part of civic life. They had halls where the community met up, they hosted picnics on days like Labor Day and 4th of July. The sponsored community events. They were much more ever present. We just don't have social institutions like that anymore. Because of the role unions had in people's lives, Hoffa wasn't some remote bureaucratic figure. He was part of a huge national community of people. He represented Mickey Mouse, your local fire department, your family member who drove trucks, etc. We just don't have anything comparable today, but maybe it's like imagining that Ralph Nader suddenly disappeared.

He, with some difficulty, took off his helmet, and remained covered only by the linen scull-cap, and then plunged his face in the water, at the same time, unfortunately, drinking large draughts; for he was thirsty from the heat, and could not quench it. He drank so much, that his blood was chilled, and a numbness of limbs seized him, with a strong inclination to faint. He could not move, and lost the use of speech. His attendants knew not what was become of him, and were the more uneasy, because many prisoners had been made: they therefore ceased fighting. Or William of Poitiers about the Battle of Hastings: [William] seeing a large part of the hostile host pursuing his own troops, the prince thrust himself in front of those in flight, shouting at them and threatening them with his spear. Staying their retreat, he took off his helmet, and standing before them bareheaded he cried: ""Look at me well. I am still alive and by the grace of God I shall yet prove victor. What is this madness which makes you fly, and what way is open for your retreat? You are allowing yourselves to be pursued and killed by men whom you could slaughter like cattle. You are throwing away victory and lasting glory, rushing into ruin and incurring abiding disgrace. And all for naught since by flight none of you can escape destruction."" ...only wearing a pauldron on the other shoulder? There were asymmetrical pauldrons on Italian plate armour with the left side having a quite large pauldron on the left side (that'd be facing forward) whilst the one on the right would be far more diminutive but allowing a far greater range of motion. Retiarii unlike most gladiators were very lightly protected with only a manica of metal or quilted cloth and a metallic belt for protection. Compared to other gladiators this was suboptimal protection and were the only ones permitted to run from their opponent; Romans thought poorly of them with the term also being used as an insult. ]"

"Can somebody please summarize Karl Poppers Criticism of the Anti-Naturalistic Doctrines of Historicism, I legitimately cannot follow him.","[2&&elmonoenano&& It's been about a decade since I've read Poverty of Historicism, but a lot of the issue with it is his definition of Historicism isn't the same as the definition used by historians. So, I think that leads to some of the confusion. Popper is critiquing the idea that the study of history can be predictive, and not in the general sense of ""We've seen something like this before"" but more in the kind Isaac Asimov Hari Seldon sense. Historians see historicism as descriptive. It explains the past, not the future. They argue that things in the past impact things in the future, this culture has this element b/c of this historic event, but not that you can predict the future, just that you can explain how past events impacted more recent events. The key thing is to make sure your clear on the difference between the naturalistic and anti-naturalistic forms of historicism. The naturalistic is easier to understand b/c it's the more formulaic and in Poppers mind works more like a hard science. There was a push at the time to make history more scientific, and that makes sense in some areas and aspects of history. But not in all areas. I think you see this predominately in cliometrics, but Poverty of History predated that by about 2 decades I think. Anti-naturalistic, is the opposite of naturalistic and that's more complicated. B/c it's not totally clear what that encompasses. Some if it is human psychology and Popper's arguments about why psychology isn't a science would apply. Some of it is theories like Aristotle or Plato's theories of history, where it's cyclical, or degrading, or to unfairly characterize Fukuyama's ""End of History"" argument, progressive. Popper's main argument is that history is not teleological. It doesn't have a goal, to either repeat in a cycle, to degenerate from a golden age, or to progress to a golden age. So, whichever factor your looking at doesn't have to lead to anything specifically b/c the relationship isn't one of X causes Y. It's more like X was involved, along with an unknowable amount of other factors, in the result of whichever end you're looking at. Part of the reason is b/c a persons motivations aren't all that predictable. X can happen and you won't necessarily always react to it in the same way. The other important argument that applies to both is that human history is a unique event, and is therefore not predictive period, by either naturalistic or anti-naturalistic versions of historicism. I hope that helps a little. ]"

If history is not deterministic then why are we learning it anyway? What’s the point of history researches when the only fruit that labour provides is just a knowledge which cannot be applied to anywhere else…,"[3&&bangdazap&& Those that don't learn from history are doomed to repeat as the old saying goes. E.g. while you can't say with 100% certainty that the harshness of the Versailles treaty caused WWII, there is a plausible case that it did, because after WWII, there wasn't another war. Instead the European Coal and Steel Community was formed to foster European cooperation instead of great power competition. (The other alternative was something like the Morgenthau Plan, basically wiping out the German economy permanently.) It might seem that people never learn from history but that is not always the case. After the Franco-Prussian War in 1871, Germany imposed similarly harsh conditions on France, hoping to cripple it permanently. Instead, they did just enough to make the French furious. So it might take centuries, but people can learn from history. Another example is ""higher criticism"", a method that was applied to the Bible and caused a profound changes in society by knocking down the idea of biblical inerrancy. ]"

I also appreciate the detachment it can give when approaching a topic through an historical lense, especially today. If you know about the reformation and the printing press, the current social situation isn't that difficult to comprehend, and understanding lessens fear. I am probably an outlier on this sub in my opinion of teaching history. I think historians as a category of person are uncommon, even those who aren't academic historians. Spending so much time teaching people who aren't historians history in the way we want it taught is wasted effort. However, there is a lot of good that comes from giving everyone a societal narrative that inspires them to be good citizens and people. This is a use for history that most people who appreciate history are wary of, but it's what we do regardless, we don't use mythology for this purpose anymore, so we put the burden on history to create a sense of wider community. ]"
how might history classes look in the future with how much information is being recorded now with technology?,"[2&&phillipgoodrich&& More and more, history in the 21st century is being taught as ""narratives"" offered up by individuals, political entities, nations, and even larger groups (alliances, empires, etc.). These ""narratives"" have to be amended, revised, rejected, and rewritten almost constantly, and it is in these narratives that history is understood. Just as an example, the American people are currently frantically rewriting the narrative of human chattel slavery as its magnitude and impact on global history is only being rediscovered in this generation. Further, the German people have had to rewrite their national narrative at least half a dozen ways in the past 100 years. History classes focus on these concepts, and invite students to sketch new narratives to address new historical problems as they develop. An interesting ""narrative"" for a history student today could address the role of Russian presidents beginning from Gorbachev. ]"

Piracy and trading went hand-in-hand in antiquity, as it did with other naval trades like fishing, and even state-sponsored militaries. There were examples of generals (to use a modern term) who owned their own triremes. You don't have one of those just for fishing with your buddies. The Illyrians are a great example of this combined lifestyle, with Queen Teuta showing herself as a leader over a confederation of peoples who use the sea for business, but also use the sea as a means for what other groups (like the Romans) might see as illegal gains -- but she claims that what they do out there is not her business. So it would make sense that there would be reports of piracy amongst groups of traders, and it would also make sense that traders might be accused of piracy by others wishing to stain the name of their competitors, but it is important to not try and group everyone together as either one or the other, as difficult as it can be.

How are wrecks still being found? I would have though satellite imagery or some other tech would have identified all wrecks in the Med. It’s not particularly deep. I recently became a certified diver and have started diving wrecks so curious.,"[3&&MeatballDom&& There's a lot of water, and most of the ships aren't that big. Though we still do lose huge modern ships. The ships break down over time, especially wooden ones. If you track all the ships ever found you'll start to see a cut off point where we don't find many ships (in water) before that. Shipworm, and other things, eat the wood, and it decays, and eventually it's gone or left in a very sad state. Finding the ram caps of ships from the First Punic War was a huge discovery, but that's all we have from those ships (though there's some armor, swords, etc. too). The stuff that's left over is on the sea floor, which is constantly shifting, so it can be covered up, and covered up, and covered up some more. Places like the Black Sea which are colder and have less sun penetration into the water help preserve ships better, and protect them from decay causing things, but if sunlight isn't getting though I imagine it's going to be tough to get satellite imagery through as well -- but satellite tech is not one of my areas of specialty so happy to be corrected. ]"

I learned a lot as a kid about that and it made me interested in the Revolutionary War period. I'd also suggest some of the great graphic novels for maybe middle school kids, like the Nathan Hale's Hazardous Tales series and for slightly older kids, the March Series by John Lewis, et al. Fro a History of my community or state, I'd suggest the Carl Abbot book Portland in Three Centuries that just got a new edition or Peculiar Paradise, which was also recently republished as a new edition. History written by someone with a different background than me is pretty much any mainstream historian, but I'll through out Caroline Janney's new book Ends of War about the end of the Civil War. For a history that's been sitting on my shelf for too long, either the Katz biography of Pancho Villa or the Grand Delusion by Robert Mann. Both are very thick and I always think I'll read them later when I have more time. History published before 2000, I've been meaning to read The Negro In the American Rebellion by Williams Wells Brown or Sylvia Frey's Water from the Rock and both came up recently. I'm constantly reading stuff that's challenged or banned. I would probably go with Never Been Caught by Erica Dunbar. I think as a book, it's pretty straight forward about what Washington did or didn't do with his slaves and his ""reluctance"" to owning slaves. I think it makes it pretty clear how silly a lot of this backlash is. For historical fiction I always like to recommend The Pride of Carthage by David Anthony Durham. It gives a perspective we don't get to see a lot and it's just a fun read. For graphic history, I'll throw March out again. For a history book on something I know little or nothing about, I've been trying to read a lot of indigenous history of people in my area b/c it wasn't something I was taught a lot about. I'd recommend The Chinookan Peoples of the Lower Columbia or Blaine Harden's Murder at the Mission, since the Whitman Incident is such a central myth in Pac NW history. ]"

Any thoughts would be appreciated. Cheers!,"[3&&elmonoenano&& Tom Ricks has a fairly recent book out (Might have come out in the fall?) that's a good place to start. It's focused mostly on the movement in the 50s and 60s. It's called Waging a Good War. Part of the reason I'd recommend it is b/c Ricks does a lot of public talks so you can find some good book talks on youtube. There are some issues with the framing of the book but he brings up the movement in Chicago and in Albany, GA which don't always get raised and which are key to understanding the movement. Those set backs provided important lessons in the running of the movement and in the difficulties the movement would face in the late 60s and beyond. I also think Ricks, b/c of his history in military analysis, is a lot more honest about some of the calculus of sacrifice that had to occur to make the movement successful. There's a spate of John Lewis biographies that have come out in the last few years. His life is a good one to use to follow the movement in the postwar period. I think Jon Meacham had one about 5 years ago. I think my favorite book on the period is Unsteady March by Phil Klinkner. This is a little more in depth so it's good to have some background first. It's a key text so it should be pretty easy to find a used copy. Almost anything your read that's published post 2005 cites this book. It does focus a little more on religion than I'd like, but since that was a key factor in the movement, and central to its philosophical framing, I think Klinkner is right about the way it was included and it's just my personal skepticism that religion actually motivates people based on growing up with the hypocrisy of post Carter era evangelists. Also, it's probably important to understand that what usually gets framed as ""The Civil Rights Movement"" is just a period of a civil rights movement in the US that goes back to at least Anthony Benezet in the first half of the 18th century. It's worth checking out books like Kate Masur's Until Justice Be Done, Jeff Jenkins's Congress and the First Civil Rights Movement (Which is about the post civil war civil rights movement, but definitely not the first) and basically anything you can read about Bayard Rustin, and Ida Bee Wells, Philip Randolph (who came up with the March on Washington during WWII) who basically ran the civil rights movement, along with notables like WEB Dubois (if you get into the topic then it's worth reading Black Reconstruction in America. It's kind of the ur text at this point. He was right well before the ethnic studies movement of the 60s got historians to refocus on the era and realize the Dunning school was basically racist propaganda), in the post reconstruction era up until the 1950s movement. A lot of the 1950s movement was a matter of people like Diane Nash breaking with people like Dubois. Matthew Delmont's new book, Half American looks at the Double V campaign which was essential, along with Randolph's work, in setting the stage for the 1950s movement and shouldn't be so divorced from it. I don't have a good book to recommend on the Truman era, but his awakening to the evils of racism in the US is really one of the more important factors in making the successes of the CRM in the 50s and 60s possible. He demonstrated a pathway that could be used, especially in the age of television, to help White Americans understand how racism actually functioned and how horrific, embarrassing, and antithetical to America's self image of a free country it was. I think part of why the US teaches the CRM as this distinct era in the 50s and 60s instead of a through line that precedes the organization of the US by at least 50 years is b/c it casts the founders in a bad light, when except for a few people like Franklin they pretty much ignored arguments about the evil of slavery for their own profit. Then regressed further throughout the first half of the 19th century by stripping rights and protections from Black Americans to cater toward poor whites, and then to cover up the horrors of the Reconstruction/Redemptionist era. If you learn about the whole civil rights movement you learn that the US hasn't been on this progressive march towards civil liberties, but is more often regressing with short bright periods of almost revolutionary advances that then begin to fade. ]"

First of all, i dont have enough time to write an essay with full on referances and citations. You can find many many books and research papers on this exact subject with just a simple Google search, even Academia would do the trick. In the video he's following some certain well known texts and subjects by telling that there is a standard bow and composite bow in Arabic archery and so on. There's an academic paper on this subject and he's almost exactly stating what's written in there. Yet he fails to mention about what's a standard and composite bow, what is the core tradition what is adopted, what is the difference in between different composite bow styles in that same paper or in almost any other source regarding the subject. It is true that archery is a big deal in Arabic culture like he said, even linked to the prophet Muhammed so it is also a big deal for muslims in general. So that is why there is a ""saying"" or kind of war cry such as ""ya hakk"" in Ottoman archery tradition. Archers would yell this right before taking the shot. There is a saying such as ""i'm the one pulling this string taking the shot but it is the god that lands the arrow and let me make this shot"" so it is a strong tradition. Yet there's one thing. Hidjaz region's traditional bow is standard wooden bow, composite bow is much later addition. There are some composite bow style that are traditional to the Middle East region but likes the one shown in the video is traditional Central Asiatic, Turkish bow to be more spesific. Type of wood, type and the way of using the glue and horn, type of string these are spesifics to the tradional Turkish archery. Even the shape is. I'm not saying Arabs never used this type of bow, i'm saying they adopted this type of composite style around this era and multiple times thru Asia conquests and later much modern versions thru in Egypt, Memluks. Composite bows are nothing new. Ancient Egypt, Ancient Greece tho theirs more related to nomadic-asiatics, Mesopotamia, China had some sort of composite bows of their own or some sort of adopted forms of it. So Arabs also had composite bow. But Siberian composite bow's traces goes beyond 3.000 BC with this style but much more simple because of technology at its time. Like the one shown in the video with M shaped, 4 layered with horns and some special glue, it is relatively very modern and you can trace its development all the way from Siberia to Asia to Anatolia and Mesopotamia of couse because it is that spesific. Also one of the bigger indicetors is the ring. Because this type of archery depends on pulling with thumb. Therefor something was needed to protect the thumb otherwise heavier bows would destroy it after a while since war bows were really heavy. So some used leather covarage and some used bone at first. Then they made a spesific ring and called it zihgir like exactly the one he wears it in the video. It has some other names but it is mostly known as zihgir and almost every name of that ring is in Farsi, not Arabic. I hope that tells something alone. I can go on and on about how this type of bow an at most is an adoptation of a traditional Turkish bow and archery style but i believe i made my point. I'm not trying to argue here as i said earlier that there's no Arabic archery, there's no tradional composite Arabic bows etc. I'm saying that this composite style is traditional Turkish archery and it is not something unkown. Infact it is very widely and commonly known for because of how spesific and different from others whic also allowed medieval conquests then getting adopted by others. ]"

They've even got a virtual field trip. https://www.ushmm.org/teach/online-tools-for-learning-and-teaching Yad Vashem also has a lot of good resources, but some of them are pretty graphic. Most states, or at least the bigger cities have some kind of Holocaust memorial society or museum. They're likely to have recorded interviews with survivors. ]"
"What are some good WW2/Holocaust docs and films for middle schoolers? We’ve been studying WW2 in my 7th grade social studies class, mostly focusing on the Holocaust. I would love to show a documentary and a narrative film on the topic during our last week (I simply don’t have it in me to lesson plan anymore lol). Any suggestions? Although my kids are in 7th I would say they’re closer to a 5th grade level unfortunately.","[3&&bangdazap&& It might be too talky for 7th graders, but Conspiracy from 2001 is a good docudrama about the Wannsee Conference where the details of the Holocaust were etched out. There's no scenes of people getting killed, just high-level Nazis talking. ]"
Appreciate it’s a broad topic but what are the best books on the Yugoslav war(s)?,"[1&&Froakiebloke&& I never actually got around to reading it myself, but one common recommendation is Silber and Little’s ‘The Death of Yugoslavia’, from 1996 so not including the Kosovo war. Misha Glenny has a book with I think the same name, believe it’s popular but can’t speak to its quality. There’s also quite a lot of ‘national histories’ that have been written, many of which give particular focus to the 1990s- Marcus Tanner’s ‘Croatia’, Tim Judah’s ‘The Serbs’, Noel Malcolm’s ‘Short History of Bosnia/Kosovo’, and some books in the Cambridge University Press ‘Concise History’ series. As I say those are less specifically about the wars but I have actually read them and can comfortably recommend them ]"
