My target audience are people who are extremely good at their particular job, and as a result, find themselves being promoted to new roles where their jobs shift from primarily being a specialist to being a leader and manager of people. These aspiring leaders will have generally not ever planned to have roles where they need to be primarily good communicators and people movers and therefore may not have any training on emotional intelligence, interpersonal communication, and in conducting meetings. These people range in age (but are not limited to) somewhere between the 20's and mid 40's. ]"

Please consult a doctor for an immediate relief. However, I don't believe medication itself will build confidence for public speaking.Afterall, public speaking confidence is like a muscle and you have to work your way up to it. That said, it is not very difficult if you do it in steps. Get familiar talking to senior colleagues of yours in non-presentation, semi-formal setting. Like office parties, after office beer-meets etc. The more comfortable you are with your prospective audience 1:1, the easier it will be for you to present to them. When you have a presentation, come early to the venue. Make sure you absorb the feel of the room. Walk casually, chat with everyone. If senior colleagues are there. Talk to them. Ask about their week, their life, their hobbies etc. But, converse don't interview. Always prepare extensively. But, in your case please do it with the help of supportive colleagues. Tell them to ask as many questions as possible which you have to explain back. The more you experience explaining other people solutions to tricky problems on the spot - the more ""oneness"" you will feel with your presentation. It will boost your confidence like no other. Please join a good toastmasters club. Use this link to find a club near you. Trust me - Toastmasters will be a game changer. I myself changed from a person who would refuse to go on stage at all to a public speaking coach today. ]"

The voice cracks because your laryngeal muscles aren’t flexible enough and they change shape too quickly. Make sure you are hydrated and flex those muscles! You could go to a few vocal lessons where they run you through scales- it’s like hiring a trainer to run you through warm up exercises. ]

But please make sure drink lukewarm water (neither cold nor too hot).Also, absolutely no beverages or alcohol. They will either dry your throat or they will be cold thus choking your voice. But hydration can only take you so far. At other times, your voice may lack range and strength needed for public speaking. And that's pretty normal unless you have been trained for stage. I suggest doing vocal workouts daily. You can also do singing exercises as well. But, if you find them too much, I'd suggest sticking to vocal workouts.

If you are presenting data, a quote, some factual information, it is good to have notes handy to make sure you give the right information. Knowing your material and your audience helps give you the confidence in presenting. IT IS OK TO BE NERVOUS. Trick is how do you give a presentation without being too nervous. Know your material. Practice. Memorize the first 30 seconds and the last 30 seconds and the main points. You can do it in pieces, ie, memorize/nail the first 30 seconds. Then review the main points and then work on the last 30 seconds. I remember someone telling me of a gentleman who was asked to participate in table topics (impromptu speaking) at a Toastmaster meeting. He was a guest and VERY nervous speaking in public. It was not a work of art. The guest left after the meeting, was gone for a couple of weeks and then came back and thanked the club. What for? was the question. The guy said, I didn't die. I always had a fear of speaking in public. When you asked to me to speak, yes, I was nervous. Yes, I could barely get a sentence out, but I didn't die. I realized my response wasn't great, but I didn't die. He took is self-realization and applied (and got) a job he was thinking about but too nervous to apply for. The point here is even polished speakers are nervous. They just use that energy to make sure they have everything in place and deliver the presentation. Remember, no one there wants you to fail so don't fret on failing. Concentrate on how you are going to give your presentation. What information you are going to relay it and how. Where are you going to stress key points, points to ponder, questions for the audience. Don't expect perfection but do give it your best shot. That's all. I gave it my best shot. I was coaching someone doing their first TEDx talk. Nervous as hell. I told her - you practiced. You know your material. You have friends in the audience. This is your dream. Don't leave anything on the table, ie go for it and give it your all. Not a completely flawless presentation but it was still a home run. She wasn't aiming for perfection. She wanted to do her best and she did. So, realize you are going to be nervous, and that is ok. But understand with practice, patience and purpose, you've got this! You are going to do your best. It may not be perfect in some peoples eyes but for you - you've done worse and what you are going to do is better! You are not going to die and you know what, don't be surprised that you've killed it! (and that is a strange use of a phrase where killing something is actually a good thing). ]"

Thank you in advance.","[2&&ButterscotchWeird689&& A thesis defense as you know is a very specific public speaking event, and we can use that to your advantage. What I might do is write down everything that you are going to say in advance - an opening statement if you will. You can then read from that script on the day of your defense. If you stumble while reading, not a big deal. Even fluent native speakers stumble over their words. But I would have some initial thoughts written down and practice those time and time again before your actual defense. What I also might do is write down at least some thoughts/responses to possible questions you're going to be asked about your thesis. What questions might they ask you? Write down a list of those questions. Then write a paragraph or two response to each question on the list. This has a dual benefit of not only educating you even more about your topic, but on the day of your defense, you will at least have some level of prepared response to common questions you're anticipating. A final thought: more often than not, the decision about whether to support your thesis, as is, or ask for revisions, so that it can be supported at a later time has already been made prior to your thesis defense. If they are scheduling you for a defense, that's a good sign. it's easy to think that the thesis defense make or breaks the accomplishment you're striving for, but I have rarely found that to be true. As hard as your defense board may be on you, they actually want you to succeed. And if they're scheduling you for a thesis defense, that's a good sign. A little personal anecdote: when I stood before my defense board for my masters thesis, they hammered me for over an hour and a half. They asked me the most minute questions, and they picked apart the tiniest detail in my thesis. When they sent me out of the room so that they could consider whether or not to award me my masters degree, I called My Wife and said there's no way in hell that they're going to award it to me. Sometime later, they called me back in the room, and said congratulations. They had actually decided to award me the masters degree prior to my defense, because it was so well written, and needed such little defense. They just wanted to see how I would respond to the toughest questions they could come up with. And apparently I had done well enough to get that master's degree. I actually got a written apology from one of the members of the board a few days later, stating that he/they should never have been so hard on me, and I almost reported them to the Dean but that's another story. The point is, just because they're hard on you in that moment doesn't mean they don't support your bid for success. Best wishes to your thesis defense. You will do great! ]"

I’ve tried to put my own points down to explain my own process when it comes to delivering presentations and speaking in public. I’ve read plenty of blogs and listened to loads of podcasts on this and some of these points will be consistent with what other people do too.

"[1&&Bengal_Miaow&&POST=Need some suggestions related speaking in front of a large audience] Hi everyone, I’m not sure if this is the right group to post about my problem but here it is. Also this is gonna be long, so I apologize beforehand. I am an international student doing my PhD in Computer Science and I have been living in the US for the last 2 years. I have suffered from depression and anxiety disorder for a very long time, even before coming here and the severity of these things changes based on my circumstances. I had made peace with that and I live with it but one thing that I have been really struggling for the last couple of years is that, I am having memory issues! It takes me a significant amount of effort to remember names, faces, small daily information and useful vocabularies!As my psychologists recommended, I went to a neurologist for a diagnosis to see if I have any brain related issue and it turned out that while there is no visible physical brain impairment, due to my constant depression and anxiety my memory has reduced significantly. So much so that I struggle a lot while speaking. English is my second language. Although I have learned it in school from childhood and all my life, these days I feel like I struggle more when I have to present my work in any kinds of settings, be it in a one-one conversation or in front of a committee or conference! Now, since I am in a PhD program, I am supposed to be (or at least act) okay with any kind of presentation, conference or long coherent conversation with people. But it is becoming increasingly difficult everyday for me to simply speak! First of all I have to do a lot of brainwork to just remember the words and think what I want to say! Then my voice cracks and anxiety kicks in and I become very nervous when I have to speak for a long time in front of an audience. I cannot make eye contact with people while talking to them and I have heard people saying that I seem not confident at all. Also because or my stress and anxiety I feel very exhausted and tired to speak most of the times! It feels as if it takes me a lot of physical and mental energy to speak in a loud voice that is audible enough and structure my thoughts into a coherent long speech to convey others! I thought may be its only because English is my second language but these days I struggle in a similar manner while talking in my native language. So I was thinking, anyone here have any suggestion for me? Anyone ever experienced any such problems like I am facing or even remotely close to it? And if you did how did you overcome it? I was thinking of some public speaking group in my university but I have found that they are too high paced for me since most of them do not come with an additional problem like memory and speech related issues and anxieties. What about voice coaching class or somewhere where I might not feel so overwhelmed at the start? Btw, I live in South Florida, Boca Raton. So if anyone can suggest any such group or tutoring near me is highly welcomed.","[2&&Happyseducer&& Hey, what you are saying makes a lot of sense. I think a few things could help a lot There are memory techniques like nuemonics that work very well. Whatever level your memory is at they can help it to work literally 5x better. Memorizing certain stories, explanations etc. in advance can help tons. It is very underrated. It's not like you need to rattle them off verbatim all the time but having like ""chunks"" of stories and explanations can give you things to fall back on and use pieces of them here and there - a bit hard to explain in writing but it works. It is crazy simple but practicing looking oneself in the eye in the mirror helps with comfort with eye contact. Doing some improv drills - in a CALM practice environment can help a lot. You can also learn some structures for answering questions, impromtu speeches etc. it makes it easier to think and remember as you fill in, or go through the structures in your mind. Repeat ^ practicing in a calm no pressure situation first is likely helpful. So up the skills a bit with no pressure , like alone or one on one or something. So you have a bit more confidence in your skill. Then do the same stuff in front of groups etc. when you practice in front of groups - what works best is a lot of fast reps - unfourtunately not many practices are structured this way but it works well. I mean like - you speak for a sentence or two , done! Then you do it again, and again. So it is short and fast with no time to think before the first one, and not enough time for the pressure to really build. It is a good way to build comfort fast and go from there. Toastmasters, depending on the club is good. Also - gonna promote myself but. I was 6x best speaker winner at columbia toastmasters - taught workshops there and mentored. Getting more into coaching. We could hop on zoom for a free lesson - no strings attached. I am certain it would be helpful. Then if YOU wanted we could do a few more ( I don't think many'd be necessary as you could then just use those skills in the situations to keep building) So feel to lmk if you want to do that, a free lesson - if not no problem, I am certain the tips above can be helpful in your situation ]"

Or will you presenting online? Online in a large group is easy - just look at the camera with some glances to your notes. Important point - IT IS OK TO BE NERVOUS. I don't think I've met anyone (professional / well trained) that wasn't nervous. Step 1- know your material. Really. That means practice it. Memorize key points/phrases. You work around presenting information with some notes. Go to Yoodli.ai and set up an account to practice. It will give feedback on your delivery. Watch how you present and make changes to improve. When speaking to a large audience, there are different strategies. You do need to look at the audience. Here's the trick, if it's a theatre style room or large audience, it's easier. Look at the middle of the room, but look around - don't focus in one spot. Pan. You're not looking into their eyes. Look a their knees or the back of the chairs. In a large room, they can't tell you're looking at them, just looking towards them. Try to get into the room and practice ahead of time. Get familiar with the room and layout. That helps you visualize the audience, where you are going to present and how.Going back to the first point. Recognize you are going to be nervous. Use that energy. Do NOT use that energy to speak faster. Use it to present your material. Use that energy to make sure everything is set, that all your material is in order, that all presentation equipment is ready. On top of knowing your material, you have to show your passion and your sincerity ring true. Be in the mindset that ""I have to tell you something important and this is why"". Not with arrogance but with importance - you want to hear this. Also, a simple point. No one is there hoping you fail, so why think you may? Practice. Know the material. Understand your objective. You have a captive audience. Give it your best shot. That is a key point. No one is expecting you to give an Oscar worthy peformance. No one is expecting or demanding perfection. Try your best and acknowledge to yourself - you are trying your best. You've got this. ]"
[2&&trick-refgret538&&POST=I have a very rare and inspirational story and am unsure how I can g it out to help people] Everyone I share my story with tells me that I should be a speaker but I don’t know how to go about it. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to get started or a place to find a mentor to get started?,"[2&&blackcloudcat&& If your story is world-class inspirational, write a book. Get an agent and then a publisher, off the back of the publicity for the book, you will get paid speaking engagements - if you are also an engaging speaker and a charismatic presence on stage. However, if your story is low-key inspirational - you had a bad accident and made a brave recovery - then you need to set your sights lower. Talks on a small scale are done for schools and for small business associations and networking groups. They might pay you a little bit, they might pay expenses only. If you then turn out to be very engaging and charismatic, you may be able to leverage that into bigger audiences and bigger businesses. So on one hand, you need to go some research about the industry. It is an industry, you need to know how it works. Organisations - if you are still in Buffalo, try the Canadian Association https://www.canadianspeakers.org/. Read their stuff, you may be able to attend of a local chapter meeting for free. That might be your best chance to find a mentor. The US equivalent is https://nsaspeaker.org/ Listen to the podcasts about professional speaking. I know this woman, she genuinely worked in the UK speaker bureau business for over a decade, now she helps speakers build their businesses. https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/speaking-business-podcast/id1363005383 And here is a list of others that should give you good information for free. https://interviewvalet.com/20-great-podcasts-for-speakers/ On the other hand, you need to work on telling your story and you need to find out if strangers also think it is interesting and find you an engaging storyteller. I'd suggest approaching local media to see if they will do an inspirational feature story about you. That's a good test of how interesting your story really is. And have them say at the bottom that you do talks for schools and associations. (Don't worry if you haven't actually done one yet, as long as you think you can do it if you get asked.) You need to set up some form of website and/or social media. People who google your name or follow a link in an article need to find you somewhere and then have a way to get in contact with you. I'm from the website generation but you might want to start doing short videos on Instagram or TikTok, showcasing some of your inspirational story-telling. Another way to get going with giving some talks is through any type of support groups around the kind of accident you had, the kind of brain / visual injury you have. (I did a quick scan of your post history.) Offer to speak for them and share your story. Any time you get to speak for anyone, collect video of the talk, photographs of you speaking and testimonials from whoever booked you. People will always be happier to book you when they know you've done something before. So getting going is hard, and keeping evidence of what you've done is essential. Finally, a downbeat piece of advice. If your brain injury has affected your speech or your ability to communicate at all, that makes it a lot harder. Being very shallow, the kind of inspirational medical story that people enjoy, is the handsome young guy or girl who cut off their arm in a terrible adventurous accident and now has a cool bionic prosthetic. I tried to mentor a lovely guy who had a terrible accident, was told he'd 'never walk again', and came back to finally run marathons. But he had a traumatic brain injury and he no longer had the cognitive capacity to cope with writing the book or with running the business. And his face and speech were affected and he just didn't have the charisma to carry an audience past that fact. ]"

I am a 26 year old male. I have been public speaking forever and I have always considered it my strongest trait. I currently am paid to give presentations to professional organizations and I also am a sports coach in my spare time. So everything I do involves some level of public speaking.

I pressed on and eventually, after what felt like an eternity, the feeling subsided and I got back in my groove. I asked a friend after the fact if I appeared out of it, and they said I did not, but I'm not sure if they were just being nice.

The issue is that I have given 6 presentations since, 3 in person and 3 via zoom, and the feeling has come back every single time.

"[11&&np819&&POST=I am a professional public speaker and I have never dealt with performance anxiety until a month ago. It seems to be getting worse and I would be grateful to hear if anyone can relate to my experiences.] I am curious if anyone else has dealt with the below issue because I can't figure out why it is happening to me or how to get rid of it. I am a 26 year old male. I have been public speaking forever and I have always considered it my strongest trait. I currently am paid to give presentations to professional organizations and I also am a sports coach in my spare time. So everything I do involves some level of public speaking. Even going back to my youth I spoke at my high school graduation, college graduation, and gave multiple presentations on behalf of my university to donors and groups of that nature. I say all of that to say, as weird as it sounds, I never once have felt any level of anxiety towards public speaking. If anything I love doing it and feel more comfortable and myself on stage. So much so that I have made a career out of it. All of that changed a month ago and I can't figure out why or how to fix it. I was giving a presentation to a local chamber of commerce at a lunch and learn. It was a newer presentation but I still had given it 5 times prior to different chambers with great results and feedback. When I started speaking I physically started to tense up, I felt light headed, and all I wanted to do was run out of the room. I felt like my voice was trembling, I was sweaty, and just felt awful. I pressed on and eventually, after what felt like an eternity, the feeling subsided and I got back in my groove. I asked a friend after the fact if I appeared out of it, and they said I did not, but I'm not sure if they were just being nice. After the presentation was over I started journaling to try and figure out why I felt this way for the first time ever. I realized that on that particular day I had to take friends to the airport early in the morning, so I was up earlier than normal on a speaking day, I was heading on vacation that evening so I had packing to do, and I had drinks with friends the night prior. I assumed it was a mixture of those 3 things, chocked it up to a learning experience, and didn't think much more of it. The issue is that I have given 6 presentations since, 3 in person and 3 via zoom, and the feeling has come back every single time.

So for my business I go around to different professional organizations and deliver presentations on different new business tools, SOPs, and other items. Think like a Ted Talk. I’ll garner interest in a subject and then take about a month to craft the presentation. Usually I take the first 2 weeks to build out the presentation itself and then the final 2 weeks I’ll work on delivering the presentation. That involves recording myself, going on walks and putting myself in different environments and giving the presentation, and then delivering it a few times to friends and family to see what could be improved. The night before and day of I’ll probably do 2-4 run throughs wearing the clothes I’ll be wearing for the presentation to myself. Once I’ve given the presentation a few times I’ll journal on what works and what hasn’t worked, and then I’ll do a few run throughs night before and day of. I don’t know if that process works for everyone but it’s worked for me until a month ago.

"[3&&real_neym&&POST=Shy but wanting to achieve being confident sharing ideas in front of many people] Hello I am an introvert, but I am an education degree student and when I was a child I am really shy, people said to me; and I realized as well that experience teaches us to be confident at anything as long as we know what to do in a situation, be familiarized and have strategies. Can anyone give some of your strategies on speaking in front of other people? I really want them to feel that they are not wasting their time listening to me I want to be active","[4&&ButterscotchWeird689&& Your audience will only believe you are wasting their time if you do. There is no magic formula to being a compelling speaker, but simply being sincere will get you so much further with an audience than any ""pretend everyone is naked"" so-called tricks. If you are interested in what you are speaking about, chances are good that your audience will be too. Introverts make incredible public speakers, and don't let anyone tell you differently. The source of power for an introvert is almost always internal – it's within you. This allows you to deliver a compelling speech, regardless of who else is in the room. Again, see my first suggestion. Extroverts often have to rely on discovering and manipulating the dynamic temperature of the room. This is not something an introvert needs to concern themself with - not nearly to the same extent anyways. If you believe in you, so will your audience. I would place my next paycheck that an introvert can deliver a more consistent speech than most extroverts - and so much of public speaking relies on creating consistently compelling content more than charismatic presenters. Give yourself the grace to learn. And fail. You weren't born walking, or talking, you flubbed that up for a long time before you got it right. Now it's something you don't even think about. Skillsets, take time to learn, but we learn them. Eventually. It just takes time. Trial. Error. And resiliency. You have what it takes to succeed- you merely need to develop what it takes. Speakers are like fingerprints, no two are identical. You are gonna get a lot further a lot faster if you look for your own style. Only Tony Robbins can pull off Tony Robbins. Only Oprah can pull off Oprah. It may feel frustrating at first, just find your voice. It'll take you where you need to go. While learning a new skill can be challenging, you also need to make space to make it fun. No, seriously. Pride yourself in trying something that you didn't know how to do well last year. You're growing. That's awesome. Most people don't do that. know that your effort is different than your outcome. And that's OK. Put in the effort, the outcome will get there. Hope thus helps. You've got this!!! ]"

"[9&&areyousuure&&POST=I feel nervous rehearsing in my living room] Hi all - I'm preparing for a presentation to about 30 people at my work. It'll be in person and I'll be standing up front to talk about a project for about 15 minutes. I haven't had to ""go up there and present"" like this in a while, so I'm trying to prepare for it. Previously, I'm a nervous speaker but do OK with enough preparation. I'm comfortable in small groups or 1-on-1 conversations though. As I stand in my empty living room practicing my talking points, I find myself nervous just being in this physical state of standing and presenting. It's as if my body is imagining what's happening and associating this act with past nervousness. Does anyone else experience this?

For me, it's usually feeling unprepared and fear of sounding silly that makes me feel nervous. So, the answer for me is usually practicing my presentation and tone over and over until I know I have it down (could be 10+ times). Then I may not feel 100% confident, but I know I'll do ok, which helps. If an important person like an exec is going to be at your presentation, maybe try imagining them in the audience when practicing. I've never felt 100% confident in a presentation, but I think the more you practice and the more you speak in general without anything really bad happening (which it never does) then your body slowly gets more comfortable with it. ]"

When you are practicing public speaking you aren't just memorizing words, you're also getting used to that awkward and anxious feeling. By just feeling that over, and over again, your brain will eventually learn ""I don't need to be nervous."" You're basically doing exposure therapy on yourself. Also, record yourself.

If at all possible, I'm wondering if it might help to do practice the actual speech in space which will be giving it. And it's actually less of a weird request than most people think. If possible, I would just go the day before to the corporate space and give yourself a couple of run-throughs. And the next day You'll have a more genuine grounding to put the anxiety at bay. ]"

Have bullet points then improvise on them. Maybe a few caned phrases. Act a little, but not to much. Don't just read it monotone, add some inflection, some gestures, etc. But don't do to much. Keep it slightly shorter than the allotted time, never go over. People will always be happier when something takes less time than they expect, they will never be happy when it takes more. (Perhaps excluding sex lol). Talk what appears to be painfully slow to you. You're high key when you're giving a speech, so things seem to happen quicker. Slow it way down. Also prevents you from getting tonged tied. Good luck, you'll do great. Edit: And have fun with it, it's fun to be the center of attention and impress people. ]"

How do I stop moving my hands extremely and so much when I talk.,"[1&&justadandak&& First step is knowing you're doing it so you're on your way. There obvious technique is holding your hands behind your back or together in front of you (as this gives your hands the haptic feedback of holding each other and can be soothing as well). Hands are great expressive tools to augment what your saying so once you've relearned their over-expressiveness you can reemploy them to add colour in your presentations. Also, one hand in your pocket is totally fine and that's another way to eliminate one half of the problem :-) All the best with it. ]"

This will make you sound less wooden and monotonic. Open by expressing gratitude. Thank the ones that made the day possible, the happy couple’s parents (single them out by name) and offer a toast to them for raising two fine people. Don’t forget to thank the audience as well. It’s a good idea to say something about how beautiful the bride looks and what a remarkable woman she is – this is guaranteed to go down well with everyone. Introduce yourself to everyone. Many people at the wedding won’t know who you are. Getting a joke in early will help relax the mood. Spend time preparing the right joke – funny but not offensive, something that will appeal across all age groups, and make sure you learn it by heart. Self-deprecation can go a long way, so it might be something told at your own expense. The audience will expect the speech to be somewhat funny so starting strongly will help engaging the audience. Every wedding speech includes a story. You can also tell a story about when you realized your brother had found his other half, or about when he would complain about being single for so long. Stay away from controversial topics Try to avoid talking about the groom’s past relationships or reveal what you thought of the bride when you first laid eyes on her. Keep it short After the bulk of your speech, make sure you list the essential qualities of the groom which you have discovered over the years. Wrap everything you have said up nicely by ending with a quote. Propose a toast. It’s time to raise your glass and toast for a lifetime of happiness and love for the couple… or something to this effect.

Talk about how grief can affect the body mentally, physically, spiritually and emotionally. Use stats to back up.the claims. Briefly explain your experience with grief. Discuss your tips for dealing with grief. Wrap it up on a positive note, reminding people that the grief never goes away but it also means that person lost stays with us (or some other wholesome lesson.) ]"

Any tips on what to say in this will be greatly appreciated and tips on how i should structure it would be appreciated also Thanks,"[2&&johncon50&& What AliceEverdeenVO suggested - as well, remind them, Not everyone grieves the same way. Don't expect everyone to crumple into a ball of tears at a loss. Everyone processes grief differently and on their own timetable. Talk about it. Share it. Do NOT suffer alone. It is OK to ask for help, to process what you are going through. It can be a friend, family, stranger, professional. There is no shame in asking for help but strength in knowing every bit of support you get helps you become stronger. I had a colleague do a TEDx on trauma. Like grief - it is NEVER over. There will good days and bad days. What helps is having support system or process in place to help you over the bad days tomorrow and 20 years from now. It gets better. It takes time, but there is less pain and more memories of the good times, the blessings. ]"

Sounds like obvious advice but practicing speaking in front of someone (or ideally multiple people) close to you is key too. My partner would fire random topics to me and I would just speak about them for 5 or so minutes (this was on the back of Table Topics from Toastmasters). ]

Just keep talking because no one will notice 99.7% of the time. Try and think of a time where you were listening to someone give a presentation or was public speaking. Can you remember what they did wrong during it ? Prob not and no one will remember when you mess up. So keep putting yourself out there. Remind yourself that you will mess up but don’t apologize for it. Just keep talking correct the information as you talk and one last thing.

If the skill disappears when you stress about it, it's not a true skill, but a lucky hit. What you can do on a good day when you are relaxed and everything is perfect... that doesn't matter. Only what you do when you ARE freaked out. So, to practice, you have to freak yourself out a little, over and over, with real life, improvised, scary situations that have relevance to the testing context. The brain's anxiety systems love repeated practice WITH other people, in real life. SO: between now and your test, you need to do 8 or more practice conversations with 3 or more different people. Hopefully a cople of those people make you really nervous. If you have resistance to these real life practice situations, that tells you how big your anxiety obstacle is. You need to do it 8 times to reduce the anxiety... and that will coincidentally increase your actual skillsets, too. Think about a True Skillset as what you do not just when you're lucky, but even when things hit the fan. SO practice by throwing things at the fan, you know?

I had a similar experience not too long ago and it was incredibly frustrating because I had been working really hard at improving my public speaking confidence, had made months of progress, had a bunch of recent success speaking in relatively high stakes scenarios, and then felt like a complete failure when I had a full blown panic attack on a fairly unimportant video conference in an informal setting. It felt like all my progress had been undone and even the simplest speaking situations became daunting again. So that’s a long way of saying you’re not alone. A few things that I have found very helpful: Beta blockers, as others have mentioned, are a great way to start to build back your confidence Breathing exercises (look up the physiological sigh, it works wonders when you feel that panic starting to set in) Practice!! Even for the simplest speech practicing is critical to get back on track and build confidence. I personally find myself avoiding practicing because it requires me to confront my anxiety about the situation and it’s a lot easier to minimize your fears than to face them. Practice anyway. Write down bullet points. Say them in the mirror. Say them to someone else. Think about where you might stumble and how you can get back on track. Emphasize the key points in your mind even if you write out a whole script. Tell someone. If you’re comfortable, talk to your boss and your direct report about it. So many people have this fear and often it’s just a fear of people knowing you aren’t a confident public speaker. You clearly weren’t too afraid to start the presentation. You had a physiological reaction that prevented you from finishing it. When you’re afraid that someone might hear your voice shake, you get even more scared when your voice starts shaking. Saying it out loud can help make that go away. Be present. If you’re in a meeting and all you’re thinking about is what you need to say in five minutes it’s easy to create a big problem out of a very small one. If you can, participate before your speaking role. Make it a conversation if you can. Conversations are easier than speeches. Exercise, get enough sleep, limit caffeine - a good approach for most anxiety disorders. As for how you move past this one bad situation, time will help but also reminders that you’re human, you’re not perfect, and people make mistakes every day. You’re going to crush the next one. ]"

"[30&&Dopamental&&POST=My First Ever Experience of Propranolol] Ever since I was in secondary school I’ve had unexpected bouts of stage fright / performance anxiety. I don’t know if it was a troubled childhood that caused it or if it’s just who I am genetically. Whenever I was in a group of people and we were going round the circle introducing ourselves, I would always have a surge of adrenaline when it was getting close to me. Profusely sweating, shaky voice (like I’m about to cry), and rapid heart rate. The usual. The same thing happened when I had to read a page aloud to the group at university, or present in front of people. Sometimes I would be fine, sometimes I would have this panic attack. Fast forward to my late twenties, I’ve had a few corporate jobs and have finally worked my way up to a point where I’m responsible for occasional projects of huge value (around £1 million and over). This requires me to present to very senior people at the organisation. I had my first of these recently. I’m relatively new to the company, and wanted this first presentation to go well. I was freaking out in the days leading up to it, laying in bed catastrophising and panicking. It transpired that my SO was prescribed these beta blockers for panic attacks and suggested them. To get to the point, I took 10mg 90 minutes before, and another 10mg 30 minutes before, as I was still feeling anxious. The presentation went perfectly. My voice was slow, calm and commanding. It was like a miracle. I felt like I could have presented in front of 2,000 people. My manager even sent me a compliment on my presentations skills afterwards. The only symptom was very light sweating. I am lucky that I can get these pills and not have it declared of my record. However, I would seriously recommend these if you relate to any of the above issues that I suffer.

I have tried to fight public speaking anxiety for years and years through “natural” means, aka facing and exposure to public speaking purposefully, doing therapy, public speaking group ect. Nothing worked. Just nothing. Every time I stood at the stage I was panicking like a tiger is about to kill me. My mind treated public speaking as life threatening experience no matter what I tried to do. I lurked on this sub and soo many people here recommend beta blockers. Once my manager told me I had to do presentation to higher ups of our new strategic plan I was completely terrified and thought that this is it, I’m done. Decided it’s last resort and asked my doctor to prescribe beta blockers. He was very in favor of the idea and told me that for most people have no side effects and that the pill is not addicting. I have used it for my presentation and oh my god. I’ve never thought that feeling that confident and relaxed during public speaking was even a possibility for me. My only regret is all the time I was agonizing in the past while convincing myself I need to work on it “naturally”. Life is just too short for dealing with this shit, I just can’t recommend enough using beta blockers. ]"

Got 4 speeches tomorrow. Already given the speech before but not helping. I know the material but sheesh,"[4&&ButterscotchWeird689&& As I read your post, it sounds like the real culprit of this experience is the uncomfortable feeling you get from the adrenaline at the beginning of the speech. In other words, the adrenaline itself is not what we want to make disappear. But the perception that others may notice it and judge us for it… that can be a real nuisance. So here's what I try to remember. No one notices what goes on inside my head.. We may think they do, that they can sense our every misstep and flaw; but their minds are so focused on their own stuff that simply don't see what we feel. They only take in what we give them. Adrenaline will come and go and they won't notice. Even if they noticed, they wouldn't care. Nobody ever says ""hey, did you see Milton's speech. Did you notice his adrenaline rush?"" It doesn't cross their radars. To lessen the discomfort of the adrenaline rush, take some nice deep breaths before you get up to speak. Know that no one has ever died from embarrassment in the process of giving a speech, and know that your adrenaline is a sign that you care, which is a good thing. Your body is literally being excited for you, and that's it. It's amping you up so you can give your finest performance. And you are always more than the dum of a single speech...or four! Get it done, try your best, and chalk it all up to a learning experience. You've got this! Best wishes going forward. ]"

Some things I've done that help: Do something proactive before the presentation with your audience. Speak to the audience, mingle, get them talking to you. It's not always possible but this is one of my favourite ways to lessen the rush. You get to expel some of that energy and create rapport before you present. I find it just builds if you're standing off quietely doing your own thing or fiddling with the technology. Be aware of it but not afraid of it. You know it's going to happen. So prepare for it. Force yourself to slow down, take more breaths, focus on your movements in those first few minutes. It WILL subside. You WILL ease into it. USE IT! I've learned it's something you can harness once you have enough experience. The first 5 minutes of my presentations are my most energetic. It's where I capture the audiences attention, get them to sit up and pay attention to me, show that I'm an engaging presenter. I don't fight it. I lean into it. I use it to power me forward. Ask your audience questions. Even if it's just getting them to raise their hand/nod their head. To me, this kinda feels like I'm transferring the rush onto them. I'm transferring energy by getting them to interact with me. ]"

It hurted so much I cried and wanted her to stop but she told me it was our secret. This continued until I was 7 and I am just now understanding that this is sexual abuse This hurts me to think about. should I tell my foster parents or a therapist?,"[2&&marcoakis&& 6hr account, shocking post.

To become better speakers not just to groups but in general?","[4&&Speakaspire11&& When you are speaking, you have less time to organize your thoughts.. a few tips I give my clients : Have a “template” for speaking spontaneously. For example use a modified classic narrative arc. It starts with the background or context, then the problem, the solution and end with the new normal. For example, If someone asks you “why did you choose this job“ you can quickly follow the template. You might respond something like “when I was young, I loved to doodle. It gave me an escape into my imagination and helped through school with my ADD. I could draw pictures to help me remember what the teacher said. When looking for a career, I knew that I wanted to find one that relied on my skills and unleashed my creativity. Then I discovered graphic design while in college. I got a degree As a graphic designer, and now I can use my doodling skills and thrive” Practice word retrieval skills. Set a timer for a minute and play a naming game. Ie. Name as many animals, (or clothes, food, etc) as you can in a minute. Count the results and try to beat your previous score. This exercises the brain and neuro connectivity to help you retrieve words more quickly! ]"

What has helped me is to have PowerPoints that adequately map out my major points so that I can talk through my thoughts in better sequence and also hit everything I want to say. For whatever treason, my mind gets jumbled up when I need to speak or present ideas and I either say things in ways I don’t want to say them or forget a lot of major points or say them in an order that gets everyone else lost. My work has a speaking group, toast masters, that is supposed to help people with speaking. It’s pretty common at larger companies (I’m based in southwest US).

Back then it was just called 'The Dale Carnegie Course'. The big take away was 'Stand up against your fears' At the end of the class 3 people get picked to do a talk the following week. So next week I was doing a talk. I almost didn't go. After finally dragging myself down to where the meeting was supposed to be I started hesitating. I just couldn't do it. My stomach was upset and I had butterflies in my stomach. Almost gagging. I circled the block and drove around 8 times before I finally parked. I was like a Zombie walking into class. Finally, my name was called and I ran up to the front and had so much nervous energy. My talk was supposed to be about 'Enthusiasm' so I decided if I actually did attend class and absolutely had to speak, I was going to blast them and give it all I got. I was hyper as hell getting to the front. During the week, I practiced being enthusiastic to all my customers. I was just out of control. Excited and Nervous. Some customers bought Manufactured Homes from me and later could not figure why they didn't wait longer which was there plan. I made a ton of money that week. When my Mom stopped by for a quick Coffee I decided to be real Enthusiastic when telling her my experience with the Dale Carnegie Course. She was just floored listening to me and signed up to take the course 2 days letter and registered for the next date it was to begin. It changed her life and one of the best things she ever did. New Friends, more confidence, more leadership skills etc. So when I finally got to be in front of the class at the end of the week, I was just wired and excited. I had everyone laughing and clapping as I told the story how I acted Super Enthusiastic when I told my Mom that day. A few people bent over almost rolling in the isles. At the end I got a standing ovation. I will never forget it. 'Stand up against your fears' was my takeaway. Now if I have to do any kind of Public Speaking anywhere it's a Cake walk. I just get up there and own it. It's hard to believe that I hesitated to attend class that night. At the end, I was unanimously voted and won 'The Mr. Enthusiastic Award' Thanks for asking. ]"
