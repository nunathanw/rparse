"[1&&binkygrandpa&&POST=21/F/Poland searching for pen pals & language exchange] Hello, I’m Zosia, I study animation and the harp and would love to exchange letters with someone, especially if you speak Spanish (but not only). I’m trying to get back on track with this language and would love to practice through writing letters/emails. I offer Polish, English, and Russian. Since I go to two schools they take up a LOT of time, so for now I’m looking for max 3 people. Animation and music (not just classical;)) are my two biggest passions in life. I love going to concerts and small film festivals in my city. I make playlists with music in different languages of the world. I also like to read, but I don’t always have much time to do it, same with video games. I draw and I’m trying to learn 3d, I crochet and go indoor climbing every now and then. I did dance theatre last year and used to hit the gym often, which I hope to get back to. I’m a huge language nerd. I have a lovely girlfriend of 2 years and a cat. I’m looking for someone not too serious ;) I like to better myself and learn as much as possible, of course, but I also like having fun doing stupid things, following internet drama or watching brainrot tv shows. I don’t look down on any hobby or interest – I might even join you in it! I’m open to listening to what you’d like to share with me. Un poquito sobre mi español: creo que estoy en el nivel a2. Llevaba 5 años estudiándolo, pero cuando fui al liceo elegí el ruso como mi lengua secundaria y ya han pasado 5 años desde la última vez que lo usé. Entiendo realmente mucho cuando leo por ejemplo, pero cuando tengo que decir algo, todas las palabras se me salen de la cabeza. Me gustaría cambiarlo y recordar más de este lengua. Me encanta la música sudamericana, folk y contemporánea. Mis artistas favoritas son Nathy Peluso y Girl Ultra. ¡Y mi compositor amado de la arpa Alfredo Rolando Ortiz!","[2&&miauanas&& Hola, Zosia :) Me llamo Mariana, tengo 19 años y soy portuguesa. Estudio Relaciones Internacionales, y me encanta viajar, escuchar música, leer y escribir. Creo que tenemos muchísimos intereses en común, incluso el aprendizaje del español! Estudio español (en el nivel B2.1) en la facultad, así que también me ayudaría bastante practicar contigo a través de cartas. Quiero, sobre todo, mejorar mi confianza y vocabulario en la lengua. Si tienes interés, contacta me por mensaje. ]"

"[1&&Intelligent_Tear_236&&POST=19M from Europe searching for a penpal] I am 19 years guy hailing from Europe. I am here to forge some platonic friendships. Sincerely, I don't give a damn about your gender, color, sexuality, or religion. However, I oppose all forms of extreme zealotry, whether they are motivated by misogyny, feminism, LGBTQ, veganism, politics, or animal rights. I value the harmony that results from having a balanced viewpoint and using reason. I'm here to create friendships based on respect and understanding. I have blue eyes, blond hair, and a height of 6'1"". I am athletic, I did judo and boxing in addition to playing basketball for 5 years before needing knee surgery. I've never been a big movie fan, but living in a new place left me with little options, so I started watching them a lot. My favorite genre is horror, and my favorite film is Green Book. 2 years ago got into cooking and my favourite meal to make is chilli. Despite how clichéd it sounds, many claim that I exude an intimidating aura and that's why few people approach me. And I entirely understand them, sometimes I think too highly of myself and come out as forceful and contentious. Regardless of how I come across, I have a dorky side and occasionally enjoy reading a good romance or fantasy book. My favorite writers come from the era of disasters (existentialists A. Camus, A. Škėma, etc.). Immanuel Kant is my favorite philosopher, and stoicism is my favorite philosophy (M. K. Sarbievijus ""What I can lose is not mine."" sadly these words lose all of its beauty in english translation). As a first-year student majoring in economics and finance, it goes without saying that I am fascinated by money and all of its machinations. The most important fact is that I have a dog and I am a dog person, If my dog doesn't like you, I won't either (or am I kidding?) I think this introduction was good enough? If you feel like we have anything in common don't be afraid to hit me up. Forgot to mention, would love to find people who are from Italy/Spain because I would love to learn those languages and I am a total nerd in history. Also I love outdoors and travels.",[1&&Equivalent-Soup-2154&& Are you trying to hookup with someone through penpals?? Cause I’m sold ]

"[3&&lez-go&&POST=27 F US - looking for someone wanting to make a lifelong friend :)] Hi there! I am wanting to find a pen pal as I have always been interested in the thought of having one. I’m hoping to find someone around my age with similar interests as I do! I currently have three cats (two of which have special needs) and I love them to death.

I’ve got a full house of pets with 3 dogs and 3 cats. Some quick likes of mine: craft beer, hockey (playing and watching), football, cooking, and being outdoors. There’s plenty more to learn about me, but that’s what the emails and letters are for. No restrictions on where you’re from or what you want to share/talk about.

"[3&&xanderblaze123&&POST=23M - Happy to be long term support and listen to your problems] Aloha, How’s it going? You need to chat to someone? Vent? Talk about your problems? Feel like no one cares enough to listen? Or you know you just want to have a couple of laughs or talk about different interests? I’m good with it all. Anyways about me: I’m 23, from London, UK Born on Halloween, I’m a Scorpio if you’re interested in that kind of thing ;) Unofficial job is being a Unqualified Reddit Therapist. I’d say I’m pretty open minded and good at giving advice and listening. Though I may give unfiltered advice and be straight up with you. If you can’t handle it, well then tough. Mix of INTP and INFP personality types. I spend a lot of time thinking. I often talk with myself and debate with myself and get my self to think in multiple perspectives. I’m very lazy and pretty stupid at times. Sometimes I’ll just say dumb or stupid things. Although I’m really ambitious too. My humour is pretty diverse. From light hearted to dark. I laugh at my own jokes, so I’m very funny. I like to joke around a lot, and make fun of you if you’re not sensitive. I can be abit mean, just a heads up. I am light brown, south Asian/Bengali, just wanted to get that out of the way, so if you’re not into that you know now. I like working out and going on walks and runs… when I’m not lazy. I’m mostly into football and basketball. Mostly watch highlights, watching whole matches is pretty boring. But I like alot of sports and getting to know them. I haven’t really travelled anywhere interesting, but I hope I can do that more into the future. I’d like to visit all the continents and have a bucket list of countries I’d like to visit. I like watching tv shows,movies and documentaries Related to Crime, Action, adventure, drama, fantasy, sci fi and more. Recommend me some shows and movies. I watch a lot of YouTube as well on all kinds of stuff. About fitness, gaming, tech, personal cybersecurity, skincare, science, animals, video essays, documentaries, commentaries, men’s fashion, interior and house design, urban planning, cars, food and recipes, social experiments, pranks, late night shows, Cats and other animals, funny stuff and loads more. I’m into universes like LOTR, GOT, Star Wars, Avatar (ATLA), Marvel, DC, Harry Potter, Narnia, Percy Jackson, doctor who and a lot more. Areas of interest: Data, Technology, Psychology, sociology, politics, all kinds of sciences mostly physics, philosophy and history. I read from time to time. I used to write but not so much anymore. Maybe will get back into it in the future. I’d like to write a fantasy or sci fi or mystery thriller novel series one day. I’ve done Shakespeare acting before. I’m into anime, manga and light novels. I’ve watched a lot, should probably do a list one day. I’ve played games under PlayStation, Xbox and Nintendo over the many years. But I primarily game on PC right now My music taste is quite diverse, from Rock, Rap, Pop, Hip Hop, RnB, contemporary classical, EDM, Indie, orchestra, instrumental, synth and everything in between. I also listen to stuff from different countries too. I’m allergic to some fruits and vegetables but I eat them anyway. I like a wide variety of food too and different cuisines. If you got this far, I appreciate you.","[1&&writingwithkait&& With this much information, I think I could write an biography on you. ]"

I am looking for at least 2 pen pals! I would like to have at least one abroad through email and one through the mail in the US. I wouldn’t mind emailing with someone in the US too. I would prefer someone closer to my age but gender doesn't matter. :) I am mainly looking for pen pals because I really just love to listen to people talk about what they are passionate about and whats going on in their lives. I’ve also had the same friends for a very long time and would really like to branch out and meet new people. Some things about me, I am a 3rd year college student from Texas. I really love music and hope to work in the music industry after college. I listen to literally anyone but some of my favorites right now would be Omar Apollo, Olivia Rodrigo, Dominic Fike, SZA, Nicki Minaj (I could go on forever on other artists I really like) I also listen to a lot of '90s and early 2000s. I love to read, YA/romantic and mystery are probably my favorite but honestly haven’t had the time for it in a while. As for movies my favorites are horror and romcoms. I love it when people recommend books, music, or movies to me so even if our taste isn't the same I'd love to check out what you're into. There’s not a ton to do in my city but i love going to clubs or parties. Sometimes I go to the bingo hall near my college.

It was my first ever flight and I wanted to get off over the ocean! • I have at least 5 scars (scars are cool) • I suck the shells when eating Pistachios (yep, it's a thing) • I have hit my head whilst running, been thrown in the air and landed on the ground having no idea how I got there!! (Shakes fist at low hanging tree bough). My family, the kind hearted souls they are, were stood laughing hysterically some distance away! • I managed to half flood (accidentally, I might add) my kitchen with bubbles (yep, bubbles!). I will recount the story if asked• I have a birthmark on the back of one leg.

"Oooo! I love QI :) Although I'm not sure my friends/family are as keen on me sharing random facts I've learned from the show with them! Half flooding your kitchen with bubbles sounds better than the thick black sludge water that backed up/overflowed in my kitchen sink from the 50 some odd floors of condos above me earlier this year! I'm still traumatized from it!! Anyways, I'm 29/F/Canada here. Living solo in a new(ish) city with my pup. An avid music fan. Enjoy cooking and (attempting) baking.

"[4&&Stock-Bus2849&&POST=32F Looking for a new pen Pal to chat with] Hello everyone! I'm a lover of making new friends, and I came here looking for like-minded people in order to expand my social circle. Making friends is an opportunity for me to have fun and grow, both in life and online. I believe that everyone has their own unique stories and values, and by making friends we can learn, encourage and support each other. First, let me briefly introduce myself. I am a lover of reading, traveling, and the outdoors. I have a wide range of interests and enjoy experiencing different cultures and exploring new things. I hope to find friends who share my interests and we can share our joys and troubles together. Besides hobbies, I also value the qualities of sincerity and kindness. I hope to make friends with those who are sincere about friendship, whether they are face-to-face friends or online friends, and I hope to build a friendship of mutual trust and support. I believe that true friendship is not only measured by having a good time, but also by being able to support and understand each other in difficult times. If you are also looking for a new friendship, why don't you drop me a message or private message so that we can get to know each other through mutual communication. Whether you are in the same city or in a different place, we can keep in touch through the network and share the life of each other. We can chat and share our joys, confusions and goals together, and even though this is only a virtual world, our emotions can be real. Finally, I believe that dating is a process of mutual understanding and growth. I hope that through this post I can meet like-minded, sincere and friendly friends, we can meet and party together, or participate in activities with similar interests together, encourage and motivate each other, and spend enjoyable time together. Looking forward to being partners in sincere friendship with you, may our friendship blossom! Looking forward to your conversations with me as well",[1&&peeppeeptoottoot&& Do you have an age cut off? ]

(Email/Reddit DM)] Hi all! When I was in college, I was super liberal, though I wasn't exactly well-informed; I kind of just went with what my friends thought and felt. Then, after college, I got disillusioned--I went hard to the right on some issues. Then, tired of echo chambers and extremist opinions, I went to the middle on most things and decided not to try to keep up with news or politics at all. It's been about 5 years since then, and now I'm out of the loop. So out of the loop, in fact, that while I lived in Florida, I usually wouldn't even know a hurricane was coming until like, the day before when my work told me they were shutting down, haha. That's how little I paid attention to news. Anyway, I'd like to be well-informed, I just...don't know which news outlets I can trust, don't know which issues are most important to keep up-to-date on...I get easily overwhelmed, especially since I don't know the history behind many issues, let alone the current state. I'd like a penpal who could help show me how to tell what I can trust. Maybe we could pick a few news issues to keep up on, we could share articles with each other and discuss. I would hope my penpal would be open to disagreement and kind when it comes to ignorance, which I know I have. Some issues/topics I'd like to learn about/be up-to-date on: What's happening in higher education (the field I work in) Israeli-Palestinian issues (and the history of it, of which I am very ignorant) What's going on in the Middle East generally French news (I'm half French) General US news, excluding presidential election stuff (I HATE election stuff, it's something I'll have to work up to being able to stomach) Anything my penpal is knowledgeable and passionate about that I could learn about We don't have to have identical beliefs, but if you're hard to the left/right with no room for disagreement, I don't think our penpal-ship will be very fruitful. Some background about me: 28 years old, white (if that matters, which it might when it comes to talking about politics), half French (dual citizenship), just moved to the Midwest from Florida Work in higher education marketing Interests: Judaism (though I am not Jewish--I'm agnostic mostly), board games, table-top RPGs, arts and crafts, philosophy, sociology, languages, physics/science No kids and not married, though I've been dating a guy for a couple weeks (but it's still early)! :P Let me know if you'd like to connect!",[1&&ihatepaisley&& Sending you a message! ]

"[1&&RulingBritannia1707&&POST=M20 Australia] Hello reddit, I’m currently looking for a Russian speaking penpal. I've been learning Russian, though I’m a complete beginner. Apart from that all I ask is that you are around my age. A little bit about me. I currently live in Australia, but I’ve spent most of my life traveling around Asia. I have a lot of interests and I love to learn new things all the time. Currently, I’m very into history, international relations and economics. I should also mention that I’m completely new to the entire penpal thing.",[1&&Silent-Importance576&& Hey there. I'm M20 from India. I don't know Russian but I've been hoping to learn it for a while. I'm also a bit interested in history and geopolitics. So if you are interested we could exchange emails or anything online. I'm also not so familiar with this penpal thing btw. ]

I love spooky movies but my spouse does not so I don’t watch them as often as I’d like. I would truly enjoy writing letters so if that’s something you’re interested in please let me know. 😊 ]

(Sounds like a job application lol) I'm an ambivert by nature but the circumstances have made me a bit more introverted. I'm a people pleaser and I'm working on stopping that. I am taking therapy. A lot of people tell me that I'm easy to talk to and that they don't feel judged by me. Yeah, I used to be able to confide in people and then I lost my trust in them. I'm kinda proud of my mental health journey. I've improved a lot during the last one year. Actually, today marks my one year of taking therapy lol. I have a weird and dry sense of humour. I'm a bit oblivious. I have a variety of hobbies including and not limited to reading, sketching, diy projects, listening to music and baking. Recently, I've been obsessed with reds and roses. Idk how the pen pal stuff works on reddit. So, please DM me and we can discuss that maybe? Also, I would prefer English language to be the primary mode of communication. Requisites for the penpal: Patience Open mindedness Maturity Willing to talk about triggering stuff (negotiable) Communicative Establishment of clear cut boundaries EDIT: I thank everybody who responded to this post. However, I'm afraid I can't accommodate any more pen pals because of my schedule. I'm extremely sorry about this :(",[1&&QueenOfTriangulum&& Hi there! We have a lot in common.

"[4&&Sage-milk&&POST=Hello my future Penpal :)] Hi again, I’m 23F from Austria and just moved to a new city where I don’t know anyone so I thought having a new penpal/friend would be very nice as I enjoy to write nice thoughtful letters :) A little bit about me: I love animals (I have a dog and a snake myself :), plants, travelling and art ! - also much more but these are the key things :) I apologize for how poorly this post is it just feels weird to advertise myself haha :) Anyways I’m very happy if you’d write me a message and become my new snail mail pal ! Ttys !!","[1&&Bookish_dreamer00&& I also lack the understanding in how to advertise one’s self in such ways. I am a 41F in the US and would really enjoy a pen pal. I have tried responding to a few of these but nothing seems to stick. I know very little about art, have pretty much only traveled within the states but hope to change that one day. But have traveled a lot within the states and have quite a lengthy wish list of places to go and things to do all over the world. I enjoy art in the sense that I appreciate beautiful things and creating things, but can’t discern artists. I enjoy a museum or show if that counts. I definitely enjoy pets, not sure about your snake though. I have the typical 2 dogs and 2 cats thing, but growing up we had a wide variety from chinchilla’s to iguanas, ferrets and such. I also have 2 boys, both sophomores just one in college and one in high school. I live in the same tiny town I grew up in and feel that I no longer really fit nor have friends but can’t leave for a new adventure just yet. I am trying the whole plant thing…have kept a fair bit of them alive when I can keep the cats from digging them up. I have learned a lot in this last year. My favorite is my Dragons Breath (not sure if that’s a real name or made up tag but the leaves are green and a deep purple red and gets little white blooms. I am new to Reddit, really only joined to find a pen pal. ]"
"[2&&AddisonEllison&&POST=35/M for committed pen pals US] Hello you lovely people. I'm seeking a few more pen pals. I have a couple already via snail mail and email, and now I'm on the prowl for only a few more. At the moment, I could be writing more and I really enjoy writing, so I'm reaching out to people who like to both read and write novels. People who might be interested in sending a couple to a few novels one week and maybe one or two the next. I'm not looking to replace anyone, but instead to add to my communication efforts. I've done this before, but not in this way. I enjoy psychology and neurology. I also enjoy studying human cognition and behavior and talking about therapy models and coaching frameworks. We could talk about how new neural networks are created and why the firing of synapses is so critical to our abilities as people. We could talk about what books you're reading. I enjoy psychology thrillers and cog-sci thrillers, although you could probably say they are one and the same, with subtle differences. Or we could talk about how you are able to transcend when you meditate. Perhaps you prefer cold coffee to warm coffee like me. I believe we heal ourselves with our thoughts, and with that, I'd like to be writing about our lives. Provide insight into who one another is. Also, did you know that Rome began the farming industrialization movement without the apparatus to create the infrastructure themselves? Every moment we have the option to create a different and new pathway in life. Please help me in creating something new. For the purposes of postage prices and mailing times, I'd prefer this pen pal to be US only.","[1&&onesmartducky&& Hello. I've not explored this subreddit in full, yet. I really just got back on Reddit. My departure was due to depression, deep, deep, life...err, just depression. In previous years, I have had penpals, but it's been a lifetime! I feel, if you were inclined to write with me, you'd probably trigger my mind to awaken, again. However, I might not be for you, and that's understandable, no harm. :) I do enjoy writing, and a novel is no issue for me. I have many pieces in my mind, just swarming and bubbling, but I've yet to put them either to pen and paper or to keyboard and computer. So you'd be helping me, greatly. I'll keep this response shorter, though and let you ask what you may. Have a stellar week. Oh, I'm a 38/F in the US. ]"

My interests in philosophy include ethics (metaethics and applied ethics), early modern history of philosophy, especially about Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, and philosophy of history. My education has primarily been in analytic philosophy, but I am open to learning more about continental philosophy! My interests in history include the Angevin empire, the crusades, the Mongol empire, revolutionary America, the progressive era and the presidency of Lyndon Baines Johnson. Outside of academic interests, I enjoy watching House MD, CBS Elementary, dating reality TV shows, Youtube video essays and period dramas. I enjoy Jane Austen's books and adaptations, as well as all other fictional or fictionalized material based on all of my interests above! I also draw, crochet, and play pickleball badly. In addition to all of that, I like K-pop, manga, videogames, true crime media, and celebrity gossip too... I am hoping to write to other students who share my interests, but also people from a different generation or location than I am. Thank you!","[1&&subtlemilk&& I am a 29F who just got my bachelors in philosophy last year. Love seeing other majors, especially female ones! I am a big fan of applied ethics and epistemology.

I got to do an honors project at my school focusing on how philosophy can be used to manage and decrease anxiety.

I am looking for a pen pal to write to about my daily life as well as the subjects I am interested in! I am LGBTQ+ friendly and based in the Midwest. My interests in philosophy include ethics (metaethics and applied ethics), early modern history of philosophy, especially about Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, and philosophy of history. My education has primarily been in analytic philosophy, but I am open to learning more about continental philosophy! My interests in history include the Angevin empire, the crusades, the Mongol empire, revolutionary America, the progressive era and the presidency of Lyndon Baines Johnson. Outside of academic interests, I enjoy watching House MD, CBS Elementary, dating reality TV shows, Youtube video essays and period dramas. I enjoy Jane Austen's books and adaptations, as well as all other fictional or fictionalized material based on all of my interests above! I also draw, crochet, and play pickleball badly. In addition to all of that, I like K-pop, manga, videogames, true crime media, and celebrity gossip too... I am hoping to write to other students who share my interests, but also people from a different generation or location than I am. Thank you!","[1&&Superb_Ad_5385&& hey! i’m a 20f junior in college and a biology major. i’ve always been super fascinated with philosophy and i absolutely love when people are passionate about a topic no matter the subject, and your interests are super cool!! i don’t know much about philosophy but i am always thinking about how and why we live the way we do— the pervasiveness of dominant structures, hegemonies, and ideologies that dictate the way in which we exist and experience the world around us. i also love manga though i mainly watch anime, video games too- zelda will always be near and dear to my heart. if u wanna talk about anything and we can share our knowledge and interests send me a DM! :) ]"
"I am a 29F who just got my bachelors in philosophy last year. Love seeing other majors, especially female ones! I am a big fan of applied ethics and epistemology. I also got to take a philosophy of science class that I surprisingly really liked (I'm not good with science). I got to do an honors project at my school focusing on how philosophy can be used to manage and decrease anxiety. I focused on buddhism and stoicism for that, but plan to expand it to existentialism, feminist philosophy, and beyond!","[1&&srsrmsrssrsb&& Wow! I also took Philosophy of Science and found it incredibly useful in following courses. I was also initially worried that my unfamiliarity with science would make it challenging, but it really wasn't that bad, at least at the level we were studying it at. I will PM you, if you are interested in corresponding! ]"

"[9&&VirginiaFur&&POST=30/f Seeking weirdos to distract me from worldly woes and responsibilities] Would you like a buddy to pelt with links to weird YouTube documentaries and other fascinating internet finds we've gathered in our short pathetic lives, feeling for a moment like the time we have spent mulling around online was not entirely wasted, until we run out of things and see if a friendship still remains? A little bit about me: I do my best to maintain a facade of being extremely cool and well socialized and definitely NOT neurodivergent in any way... I mean in all honesty, I've done an impressive job at appearing normal in society and have a really convincing ability for small talk. I do actually really enjoy small talk, and observing the flow of conversation with someone I don't know at all. I think I can talk about most anything. I'm a first generation college student in grad school studying pollination ecology. Getting paid to get my PhD. Honestly school/ academia is the only place I've truly excelled in life. So what do I do after this? I don't know. But I can offer you hours of botanical/ ecological/ evolutionary musings. I am a botanist, but also enjoy talking about evolutionary theories, animal behavior, human behavior - especially in the context of evolution and physiology... but I'll also listen to you complain about your mother in law. I love hiking and yoga. I tend to feel more comfortable in the more woowoo yoga studios, but don't really take any of that spiritual shit too seriously. Oh but I love talking about spirituality and religion - and if you are spiritual or religious I think that's really cool and I'm interested in talking about it. I had a mini stint as a Catholic (probably as some kind of a trauma response tbh), and I was super into it for a bit. I was confirmed in Rome by a Cardinal. I'm not religious now, but the point is that I have respect/ understanding for people who are. But I can't promise you that I will withhold skepticism if you went to a psychic to determine the sex of your unborn child or the inner thoughts of your dog. Oh and if you want, let's watch Epic Psychic Fails compilations on YouTube. Anyway, I also love sharing art, lit, music suggestions. I'm into all kinds of stuff. The stranger the better. Outsider/ untrained artists. Stuff YOU'VE made. Hmm so some prompts to help you if you're interested (though honestly I'm super easy to please): send me music recommendations such as a sultry female jazz singer, or something dreamy and ethereal that David Lynch would choose for the Roadhouse, some goofy or glitchy electronica, or some weird moog album send me a reading suggestion for something surreal, or your favorite fairytale, especially fairytales from your culture send me a poem you wrote a drawing you made your favorite book or the last one you read with a review tell me about the last hike you went on Anyway I love emails, snail mail is fun too. I especially love hearing from people from different cultures or small towns or anywhere...","[1&&peeppeeptoottoot&& Pollination ecology? That sounds really interesting, and necessary.

So I'm hoping to not only be pen pals but hopefully create a friendship as well. Someone I can share life with, be there for, and just create a beautiful connection.

"[2&&thepacyacetbh&&POST=24M | USA | Just having fun!] Hey everyone! Recently tried the pen palling, and it’s been pretty cool meeting new people and having conversations or quick chats! Still find it fascinating meeting people from all over the world, including people from my own country. as i’m slowly finding myself with more time on my hands, would like to continue giving pen palling a shot. A little about Me: i really enjoy music + movies (something about film scores, they’re amazing) and playing video games on my spare time (not the best, but i enjoy to just chill and hop online with friends); i want to get back into reading (currently pushing through Dune, with any other recommendations welcome); I am a huge sports fan, played basketball, soccer (football for the folks outside of the US), baseball, and American football. although i would like to say that i can get into any sport if i find it intriguing I’d say I do fairly well with talking with just about anyone; listening and helping are some of my strengths! If you share any of these interests, or just want to give it a shot, feel free to reach out via Reddit DM! Being 18+ would be appreciated lol. Warning: still adjusting to world of Reddit, so i’ll be working on my responsiveness lol.","[1&&NeighborhoodWise7659&& Hey! I'm 23 yo from Italy, would love to have a penpal to share moments and chat with. If you're ok with it, we might try! I'm new to this sub idk how it works ]"

I’ve had some great email penpals in the past and miss the feeling of getting a lovely message in your inbox every so often, so that’s why I’m using this tag.

"[4&&MangoGoat2408&&POST=20m UK, looking to engage in some interesting conversations] Hi everyone! I am a history student form the UK who is absolutely in love with reading and writing. Most of what I consume tends to be either science fiction of fantasy (there is a special place in my heart for Warhammer, but there is also plenty of other stuff besides). Currently writing a fantasy novel of my own, I am trying to finish it off soon and getting published would be my absolute dream. I am getting much more interested in philosophy as my adult senses awaken and I view the world around me, just trying to find and understand my place in it. I am also very interested in video games (though I don't have much time to play them anymore) and I am really into music. Unfortunately, I don't have the skills to play anything, but I especially love progressive rock/metal, alternative rock/metal, as well as some really basic white-girl shit. I have never had a penpal, but for the last few weeks have been thinking about it. I think there is something really interesting communicating with people in the 'old fashioned way', especially if they are from distant places. Having to really consider every word, factor in what might happen during travelling times etc. is fascinating to me, and besides the pleasure of having a friend whom you can communicate with in an oddly close way, I think there is quite and interesting cycle of thought processes behind it. If you are interested, please DM me! I have no real preference regarding male, female, trans, NB etc. or age really, thought I would prefer people closer to my age. As long as you are willing to put some thoughts onto paper and have a genuine conversation with me, then that is great! Also, if it matters, I am willing to exchange pictures if you want to see who you will be talking to. Personally, I find that it helps to really humanise each other. I look forward to hearing from you! Thanks for reading.",[1&&CathyCampos916&& A fellow metalhead! I'm 19F from the Chicagoland area 😸 ]
"[4&&SBPCapturedPoet&&POST=Cosy Autumn Requires Tea and Time Spent Deep in Thought [M/30/England]] Hey everyone! I can feel that time of year encroaching upon us... the time of red flames crackling on the candles as the sun starts to slumber early. Those infinite evenings in which the sky is black frost speckled with those pulsing white stars. Leaves abandon trees and dance merrily down the street, caught on gusts of wind that will take them to their final destinations. There's so much beauty to witness in autumn, and then, shortly thereafter, the winter.That's all well and good I hear you say, but what does that have to do with writing letters? Well, let me attempt to answer that. It's quite simple really, I want a handful of penpals in my life I can enjoy this experience with! I quite like the idea of knowing that, as I stare up into that big, open sky - which can shift my feelings so splendidly, as my eyes venture back and forth, from loneliness to hopefulness and back - that somewhere cosy, there's a thoughtful person carefully curating their thoughts, about to make me privy to their hopes and dreams, about to share a little slice of their life with me. I mean, how wonderful is that? The possibility that we're connected, even loosely, with someone else who might be jubilantly watching the steam spinning out of their mug, listening to their favourite song... whatever. That's my definition of magic.I do want to make it clear though, that I'm not always such a stargazing, serious bore. I do enjoy a bit of banter here and there, promise! A little more about me, I guess? I'm quite into music, poetry, anything artsy. I'd love to hear some suggestions for an autumn playlist. (Don't you think that it's quite nice to shake up the music you listen to with the passage of the seasons?) Equally as happy to talk about your big philosophical ideas as I would be to listen [well, read] to you tell me a story about your crazy uncle with a wooden leg (yes, it's absolutely obligatory if you want to reach out that you have such an uncle!). Currently work for a charity that's quite well known across England. Perpetually struggling with some sort of uniquely English identity crisis in which I'd like to think of myself as working class, but my accent and penchant for shopping at M&S begs to differ. Oh, and I can cook a mean spaghetti Bolognese. Not sure why that's relevant, perhaps I just wanted to brag. :DMassive appreciation if you managed to navigate this lengthy advertisement!Also, mostly happy to chat with everyone and anyone, though the only thing I would request is that, hopefully, you'll be over 21 years of age. Much love Reddit. <3 Oh, blimey, forgot perhaps one of the most important points! How do I envisage our correspondence working? In as much as I do love the idea of writing good ol' fashion snail mail, I would, ideally, like to communicate slightly more frequently than this would allow... so maybe we could write messages on here or via email predominantly, and drop the other party the occasional handwritten letter on and as and when basis?","[1&&One_Strawberry_1791&& Oh!

Some of my current favourite bands include: Mourning Beloveth, Candlemass, Paradise Lost, Woods of Ypres, Saturnus, Drown, Audioslave, Divercia, Saint Vitus, Kyuss, Blood Ceremony… My other hobbies include journaling, watching Star Trek, collecting stationery (although I like Metal, I’m a big fan of anything kawaii!!) , collecting antique furniture, Vinyls and CDs! I have a thing for old stuff preferably from the 1900s or 1970s!! If you think we have something in common and you’re also interested in sharing your favourite bands, albums or music recommendations feel free to dm me! :) ]"

I am looking for somebody aged 25 - 30, I am not bothered about your gender. I want somebody who will be equally as excited about the concept as I am and for us to share everything from our daily lives to our deepest fears and everything in between. I would love to send each other postcards after a while of emailing, I just think it would be so cool especially as everything is electronic these days, I live in the UK. It would be nice to have a penpal from America, Canada or Australia but I'm not picky.

"[8&&TGMomVanessa&&POST=USA/43/TransMtF - Lonely Mother Looking for friends to pass the time with!] Hello there, I'm Vanessa. I live in the East Coast of the United States. The first thing you might notice if you clicked on this post is that I am a trans female. That means I have transitioned from male to female presenting. I do not mind talking about it at all, and I know many are likely curious about it. That being said I have zero interest in discussing the social-political landscape surrounding LGBTQ+ issues. I am not an ideologue, I am just me, so I can't properly represent anyone but myself. So what's next? Oh yes... I'm a mother of 4 children! I'm sure that given the previous statement there's questions surrounding the nature of that. To put it in as succinctly as I can, I am my children's ""biological father"". Now that the mechanics are out of way, I have 4 children. I am currently single (full custody of my kids), and I work as a loss prevention officer (the security person who makes sure you don't steal stuff!) As for what I like? Well as a full-time mom I'm largely influenced by my kids interests, as such I read a lot of books, watch a lot of animated movies, play video games (love simulation games and RPGs!), I like to cook, dabble in photography (nature mostly), and there's plenty of other hobbies I have that you're free to uncover! I am a very easy-going person, with a bit of that southern hospitality flair (If I say babe, or sweetie, don't take it too personal it's just a southern mom thing I do). I'm looking for interesting and unique individuals from all walks of life. Your age, gender, background, and beliefs don't really matter, I mean they do, but I won't judge or filter someone on account of it, I believe everyone has something to offer. I'm very difficult to offend as well so don't worry about walking on egg-shells around me, I am not the type of person to assume the worst in people. What I want is someone willing to write, and write a lot, like pour your heart our. Ramble about any topic you want. Write me a 5 page thesis on why you like butterflies. Rant about your day. Talk about your hopes and dreams. Discuss life, the universe, and everything! I don't really care the topic, let's share in the good times and the bad. If you need a close friend, or a caring mother in your life, I am here. I want to be someone's BFF, close confidant, and whatever you say to me stays with me. I'm not too picky about how we go about corresponding but I will give priority to those who write an extensive introduction more than just a ""hi"", let me in to know who you are and I'll gladly talk more with you!","[1&&sentinel618&& Good Morning, 43/UK here.

Best friends with cats. Anime junkie. Serial gamer. Music obsessed. Logical. Sarcastic to a fault. Somewhat melancholic. Occasionally brooding. Complicated and quirky with an ""old soul"" nature. To summarise, a bit of a weirdo drawn to the darker side of things. Also a traditional, doll-esque ""creepy cute"" artist; my art involves a pop-surreal style with sweetly macabre themes. I also write snippets of story for my favourite creations, in the form of whimsical little poems. Seeking, hopefully, a pen friend or two. Introverted hermit, as previously stated. I've a few acquaintances but little actual friends. It's very difficult to connect with others in real life, especially on a deeper level; I've always been the slightly misunderstood, ""odd one out"" type. Which is why I enjoy pen pal correspondence. The degree of distance, anonimity and lack of physical presence soothes my anxiety, which is often extreme, allowing me to be true to myself. So, looking to share interests, stories, daily life. Maybe even small gifts, little bits and bobs, etc. Perhaps we could art trade? It's been some time since I last wrote a physical letter; I miss sitting down to compose with my favourite writing paper in hand, and yearn for that little rush of excitement and spark of joy when a letter arrives on the doormat... It's worth noting that I am not searching for anything romantic or at all flirtatious as far as correspondence goes and am only interested in forming a purely platonic pen friendship, steadily over time. Mostly, I find I've more in common with those in my own age group. I do admit to being slightly wary of those with copius amounts of pen pals. In my experience, they communicate more generically, which usually leaves me feeling more like a number on a list rather than a person. I tend not to write too often nor too little; you could expect to receive a well composed letter once per month. My preference would ideally, of course, be with someone of the same feeling who is genuinely interested in forming a friendship. If you're of a similar persuasion, then I would adore hearing from you.","[2&&wdmzjh&& Hey, I agree with you.

Sorry if I am not doing the right thing, but I’d just love to get involved and make pen pals! I had a pen pal once when I was very young as our class teacher was friends with a teacher in another country and we would exchange letters with the students of her class. Even back then I thought it was really cool and wish we had kept up with it. I love to learn about other countries, cultures and languages, and as an introvert, I think letter-writing would be an amazing opportunity to ‘meet’ new people too! (Although I’m not sure if people do really write letters anymore - do people on here tend to email?) Some info about me is that I love history, i love Eurovision, I enjoy art, travel, reading, collecting things (especially stamps and patch-badges) and generally just learning about stuff! Either way, I’d love to be able to exchange letters with someone and just learn about you and your country and maybe make a new friend! I have no preferences for identity, age or religion, I just love to learn about people!

"[10&&GayBallOfAnxiety&&POST=A Call to the Guiders] Hello, everyone, I hail from the Lumbee Tribe, of which I am a member, and Pembroke, North Carolina. I spent my 26 years by my mother and grandma’s side in the kitchen—where my love for cooking and baking was initiated—in my grandpa’s garden, and at the piano of the Baptist church he built. After a childhood instilled with conservative and Christian values, I was “outed” several years ago and ostracized from a dear half of my immediate family for my sexuality. Then, a few months ago, my grandpa (and childhood best friend) passed away, and my marriage to my husband ended the next day. After wallowing for a season in depression and self-pity, I am returning to college this fall to complete my bachelor’s degree in English with a minor in Sacred Music. I am also academically interested in my tribe’s struggle, since 1888, for Federal Acknowledgement (“recognition”)—especially within the larger historical and contemporary context of U.S. Federal Indian policy (i.e., assimilation, termination, self-determination). The genocide and continuous atrocities committed against Indigenous People in the making and expansion of America—the blood sacrifice required by “our great experiment in democracy”—should, in all human hearts, demand respect for Native American tribes’ sovereignty, which my tribe, for 135 years, has been denied. Lately, I find myself reflecting on and missing the relationship I had with my grandpa: he confided in me his sorrows and regrets, his joys and prides, and of his claim to immortality through his God. Through a childhood of confusion and neglect, his patient wisdom and earnest guidance were a source of strength and a refuge I now yearn for. And though he is gone, the nature of our friendship need not be. So here is a call to the Guiders. Tell me about the darkest days of your life and how you made it over—the days you started and finished with a belly full of hunger or the times you couldn’t stomach your own reflection for shame. As if your child or the twenty-something reflection of yourself, advise and apprise me of all the things you’d have me know to get me through this world easier and finish a beautiful life without shame. Tell me all the wrong things people in your time and mine have wasted their lives chasing and where, if ever, they found redemption, for “I [do] not wish to live what [is] not life, living is so dear.” I seek true-hearted pals and confidants. I seek the people who have been to the woods and lived deliberately. I seek those who have “[confronted] only the essential facts of life, and [seen if they] could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when [they] came to die, discover that [they have] not lived.” p.s., I do not expect us to agree on all things! “Friendship that insists upon agreement on all matters is not worth the name.

I like trying new types of tea, caring for plants, building keyboards, videogames, and occasionally sitting down to read a real book. I’m also a film student at a local program. If you couldn’t guess I’m fairly introverted and mild mannered but I think I open up to new people fairly well and have some fun views of the world. I am absolutely fine with being friends or at least chatting with people from any place and of any age/gender/identity, so don’t be nervous to say hi! I would prefer to write letters but if you’d like to do daily emails or something like that I would enjoy that too :]",[1&&mahkyavelli&& hey I would love to exchange letters with you ]

I spend a lot of my time working a lot of different jobs that range from caretaking to construction.

I don’t have many hobbies, but I’m extremely crafty/artsy and I love creating in any way possible whether sewing or taking photos or whatever outlet I’ve found for the week.

"[4&&Gallaway1&&POST=31M/US - Any artists want to connect and share art?] I think it would be fun to connect with an artist and occasionally exchange for art in addition to physical letters. If that sounds interesting, keep reading! A little about me – 31M from a small city in upstate New York (not NYC!). I’m married, and I have a big, beautiful rough collie dog. I have a ton of things going on, and I’d love to add a pen paling to the list! I’m a professional YouTuber and entrepreneur. For my hobbies, I’m really into music. I play multiple instruments, I’m in a band, and a write and produce songs. I’m also a decent oil painter, but I’ve been taking a break, and it would be fun to use this to get into it again. I do a lot of outdoor stuff, like hiking, camping, and my favorite hobby, letterboxing (look it up!). I read a ton of fantasy novels, play video games and I’m into a ton of Japanese media, like anime and visual novels. My wife has penpals and it looks like a lot of fun, so I’m looking to connect with some people. If you are an artist, and do you want to occasionally exchange art, that would be a bonus, but isn’t necessary. Male or female is fine, and someone not in the US would be ideal, just so we can learn more from each other. Also, the pace of sending letters internationally is a little bit more my speed. I’m not interested in weekly letters, I got a lot going on, and I’m only really looking for one or two people. Anyways, let me know if you’re interested. We can send some emails first but I would enjoy sending letters ASAP if you want to continue.",[1&&vampyyrikala&& I'm interested! ]

"[4&&Curious-Alps7781&&POST=31M Exploring the Online World: Seeking Curious Souls for Email and Chat Adventures] Hey there, future penpal pals. I'm just your friendly neighborhood explorer from India, on a quest to make new friends and discover the world, one letter at a time. By day, I'm work as software developer, learning and growing as I go.. But when the sun sets, you'll find me in my kitchen, whipping up a storm (hopefully not a culinary disaster) or diving into a good book while my stove is working hot. Apart from my day job and culinary escapades, I'm a cosmic dreamer with an insatiable curiosity for the mysteries of the universe. Yep, that's right, I'm into astronomy and physics - I mean, who wouldn't be fascinated by the cosmos and its mind-boggling wonders? And if you ever need someone to geek out about history, geography, or engineering with, I'm your go-to history buff, map enthusiast, and tech aficionado all rolled into one. But wait, there's more. I'm also a volunteer an NGO, where I connect with amazing people from Ukraine, helping them improve their English skills. It's not just about languages; it's about connecting hearts and bridging gaps. When I'm not busy with all of that, I'm an noob gamer, a collector of world movies, and a connoisseur of good humor. So, if you're up for some light-hearted banter, cultural exchange, and forging a friendship that spans continents, drop me a line. Let's embark on this epic penpal adventure together. Who knows what exciting tales and laughter-filled exchanges await us.","[1&&[deleted]&& Hi there, u/pasukiforever! looks like your comment or post contained a form of communication not suited for this sub (social media, Discord, instant messaging, Reddit chat, texting etc.) You can check the sidebar for a more appropriate subreddit if you're not interested in long-form communication.

"[21&&yuzukou&&POST=36F - Late starter in life, looking for genuine connection [LGBTQ+ friendly]] Hey all! I have never done a penpal thing before, but it feels like the thing I'm missing. This year I shed a bunch of friendships that I realized were weighing me down and making me troubled, and now in my senior year of university I am basically completely alone. It's mostly okay, most days I don't feel lonely and I'm very focused on my studies. There's just fleeting moments where I wish I had someone to talk to. But I'm not looking for the small talk, scratching the surface, shallow kind of friendships anymore. For me, human interaction has to have depth. I want to hear about philosophies and perspectives on what really matters in life. I want to know a person's flaws that they're ashamed of as much as the strengths they take pride in. I want to know what troubles them, their past, how far they've come. And I want to be able to feel like I can speak honestly about my own story, my own reality. The biggest thing of all though that I desire is consistency. Previously, I made a lot of friends that seemed close, but they wouldn't reach out to me unless I reached out first. I don't enjoy knowing that if I don't make the effort, we simply wouldn't talk. Hence why I decided to try finding a couple of penpals. In this sort of arrangement, there isn't that problem. With how busy I am in uni with senior projects and such, I don't have the time or the energy to sit around chatting every day anymore. But a few letter-format communications over email or DM each week here and there sounds very doable. Some summary about me: I'm currently studying Animation at a public California university. I am learning how to code on the side, and would like to build apps and games down the road that combine my creative skills with coding. I am mother to two cats and I love them dearly. My looks and my maturity have yet to catch up to my age and I'm not sure they ever will -- in fact people at my school guess that I'm around 20-25 and it's kind of hilarious. I am non-judgmental and welcome any race, and any LGBTQ+ individuals as well as those on the autism spectrum. In fact, I am personally part Filipino and bisexual, and I feel I will be able to relate to a variety of issues that minorities deal with. I have lived a very turbulent life from about age 7 onward, and I have a lot of trauma. I have had experience with SA, DV and even homelessness. I was born into poverty and didn't have anyone to guide me as I came of age and knew very little about what it took to get into college. So I wasted my 20s on romantic relationships, partying and video games. When I finally saw a pathway and resolved to build a future for myself, I was 29. I moved across the country to be where I am now. I am mostly estranged from family. I was diagnosed with GAD and MDD and take medication, and have yet to see the proper specialist but I strongly suspect C-PTSD and possibly even ADHD that wasn't caught in childhood due to my mother's very low frequency of doctor visits for my siblings and I. (I'm talking like 3-4 years between visits.) I don't seek anyone's pity, but I do feel I should be upfront about baggage, which is why I'm laying this out. I only want to speak with people that understand and accept me for everything. My interests are basically anything animation, film, TV and video game related, music (I love a lot of genres and eras), mental health, content creators on YouTube/Twitch etc, manga, anime, fanfiction, webtoons, creative stuff in general, history, philosophy, sociology, psychology, earth science and anything animal related. I often go down rabbit holes on the internet, reading about stuff for hours that I previously would have found boring when I was younger. :) My current fixation is AI and how it is already affecting society. Anyway, if you're still reading this long post, I am open to being penpals with both women and men, but prefer women. So, yeah! Private message me if you are interested in being my penpal and introduce yourself. Be sure to specify if you're good with Reddit private messaging or would prefer email.",[1&&PotatoGirl104&& I sent you a private message! ]

"[3&&astrohugh&&POST=18 yo looking for friendships (LGBTQ+/allies)] Hi! My name is Hugo and I'm from Portugal. I'm currently using any pronouns. Sticking with writing letters via email for now, but want to eventually do snail mail. I'm a passionate classical musician (pianist and violinist) who likes to draw and who recently developed an interest in coding. However, I have tons of interests, ranging from literature to astronomy, philosophy, etc. I've always been keen on studying and doing research on different subjects and topics. If possible, I want to spend all my life studying and learning as much as possible. I love to read and to write! At the moment I write mostly poetry but I'm hoping to be able to write fiction in the near future. My poetry looks more like spontaneous outbursts of emotions and experiences I'm struggling with, making my writing very personal. I'm always trying to improve the way I write and I even have a poetry blog (I write in English despite being Portuguese) to keep my progress in check. I'm also determined to read the highest amount of literary classics I can. Something that has shaped my life is the constant search for the self, who am I, what shapes my identity. It was hard for me to move on from society's expectations of masculinity and binarism. It still is. It's a battle I've been facing for most of my life. Up until some months ago, I was trying to push the male label and a masculine gender expression onto myself, but I found that I'm so much more than that. I've been constantly flowing and nothing has remained the same. I currently identify as genderfluid (although I do feel more like a feminine male most of the time) but who knows, I have yet so many changes and realisations ahead of me. I decided to get into this whole pen pal thing because I've always loved to write, have always wanted to send letters, and have always longed for in depth conversations and connections. Shallow, empty exchanges are something that I truly dislike. Recently I haven't had the time or the energy to keep instant messaging people, but I look forward to this way of communicating. Each letter is unique and has much more thought put into it, since we take more time to reply. I am available for a committed connection, most times replying within a week. If I get really busy or tired I might reply within two weeks. Please keep in mind that I'm neurodivergent, so that's mainly why I might need to take my time. I will be understanding if you need to take your time as well. In terms of letter length, I prefer medium to long letters. I want people to have a space to get their feelings, thoughts, experiences, and philosophies out there. I will happily read through it all. Thank you for reading!","[2&&DisasterWolf76&& Hi Hugo!

It has been very long since I moved here late and its hard to make friends at this age. I like writing ever since I learned to write and has been keeping letters for ages. I would like to have penpals from all over the whole and exchange mails, letters or postcards! I love travelling but stopped since I decided to further my education here in Canada.

"[8&&monster3381&&POST=Give me an excuse to write more!] Hello! I'm currently 26. Female (she/her) I live in the state of Idaho in the USA. I posted here almost 2 years ago now and I have gained so many amazing penpals through here. Some have stuck with me the entire time, some have come and gone( I wish them the best ). I started this penpal journey because of my amazing grandfather. I did not know him growing up and he managed to find me. After only having him in my life for 3 years he passed away. He and I wrote letters back and forth the entire time and I was lucky enough to visit him in person just a few months before he passed. Even though I only had him in my life for a small period of time, our relationship taught me so many things and he had a profound impact on my life. One thing I learned was how important relationships are in life, even the small ones, or ones that last for a short period of time. As I continue to float through this beautiful and awful thing we call life, I wish to get to know as many people as I can. You never know who could change your life or whose life you could change. A little bit about me! I have a love for cute stationary, stickers etc. I love taking photos with my polaroid and sharing the beautiful place I live with other people. I love to do things outside (kayaking, camping etc.) But I also love being a homebody and just vegging out on the couch, watching anything and everything you can think of. I am also currently 6 months pregnant with my first born! You don't have to be super consistent, you could send a letter once a week, once a month or once a year and I would still love to get to know you! It doesn't have to be a novel, but it can be if you want! If you'd like to get to know me, feel free to reach out! I hope you all have a lovely day!",[1&&AddisonEllison&& Message sent ]

"[4&&brownbjorn&&POST=29 M / Los Angeles looking for postcard / snail mail pen pals] Hi all, I'm 29, M, from Los Angeles (Pasadena actually) and I'm looking for some snail mail or postcard pen pals. I'm a software developer, husky parent, amateur piano player, and currently going to my old community college to learn German, so it'd be cool if you can speak some German but absolutely not necessary. I speak Spanish fluently and learned some Norwegian as part of my first job. In my free time I enjoy going to the gym, music festivals, and bouldering. Besides LA I've really only lived in San Diego, so I'd be pretty cool to get to know some people from the east coast or anyone that's outside of the USA. Interesting thing that happened recently, I survived the hurricane that came through Los Angeles, and the earthquake. Oh, and I just found out my insurance doesn't cover invisalign, but does cover traditional metal braces, so I might have to deal with having metal mouth for a few months, hopefully less.

An only child raised by a single mom, they were very close and this has impacted him in ways I’d never imagined seeing until later in life. I don’t want to make this a tribute to his mom as we will be honoring her first birthday in heaven next month, I just want to support him, celebrate him, and let him know how loved he is, while giving him something that may offer a bit of distraction from the pain- I’m hoping to flood the mailbox. 💌 If you’d be interested in sending a card, postcard, short note with well wishes, please send me a PM requesting the address.

"[4&&MangoGoat2408&&POST=20m from the UK] Hi everyone! I am a history student form the UK who is absolutely in love with reading and writing. Most of what I consume tends to be either science fiction of fantasy (there is a special place in my heart for Warhammer, but there is also plenty of other stuff besides). Currently writing a fantasy novel of my own, I am trying to finish it off soon and getting published would be my absolute dream. I am getting much more interested in philosophy as my adult senses awaken and I view the world around me, just trying to find and understand my place in it. I am also very interested in video games (though I don't have much time to play them anymore) and I am really into music. Unfortunately, I don't have the skills to play anything, but I especially love progressive rock/metal, alternative rock/metal, as well as some really basic white-girl shit. I have never had a penpal, but for the last few weeks have been thinking about it. I think there is something really interesting communicating with people in the 'old fashioned way', especially if they are from distant places. Having to really consider every word, factor in what might happen during travelling times etc. is fascinating to me, and besides the pleasure of having a friend whom you can communicate with in an oddly close way, I think there is quite and interesting cycle of thought processes behind it. If you are interested, please DM me! I have no real preference regarding male, female, trans, NB etc. or age really, as long as you are willing to put some thoughts onto paper and have a genuine conversation with me, then that is great! I look forward to hearing from you!","[1&&00Fluctus00&& Hi I'm 22F Korean! I really do love reading and music too!

I'm also a bit woo-woo, meaning I believe in some spiritual or mystical things that are not easily explained by science. I'm hoping to find someone who is open-minded and curious about the world, and who is willing to write to me regularly, maybe a few times a week. I think writing is a great way to express yourself and to connect with others on a deeper level. I'm looking for a long-term friendship, and preferrably not just a casual exchange.

Once a strange child, I am now an unremarkable (but maybe still strange) adult, curmudgeoning full-time and probably unfit for any profession other than lighthouse keeping. I have two dogs (both small and dishevelled), one step-cat (large and orange) and one significant other.

I love nature non-fiction, knitting, stargazing, classic British folk horror, seasonal rituals, napping, women surrealist painters and, most recently, moon gardens. Having the same interests is not as important to me as writing to people who are passionate and curious in general. I can offer 1) letters via email at the pace of letters via post (I realise this is the worst of both worlds for some), 2) strange nature facts (did you know whales are more likely to beach during solar storms because they use the earth’s magnetic field to navigate?), 3) advice on dealings with na daoine maithe, 4) keen interest in your interests, hobbies, and opinions and 5) too many follow up questions.

A little bit more about me: I live in California, I'm studying microbiology, and I'm planning to go to grad school in a few years for a career in medical research. I'm originally from a rural area, and I love nature, especially identifying birds and plants. I'm not a good cook, but I love baking. I love hearing other people's taste in music because I think it gives so much insight into their day-to-day-- some of my own favorite artists are Fiona Apple, Simon & Garfunkel, Lorde, and The Cranberries. When I'm not busy with school I watch too much TV, especially comedies and trivia game shows. I finished Nathan for You recently, and some of my all time favorites are Arrested Development, Parks and Rec, and Veep. I've seen the movie Ratatouille roughly a billion times.

I'm also always interested in personality tests even if I don't put much personal stake into them: for anyone interested, I'm an INFJ and 5w4. I'd like to start with email, and then potentially go to snail mail (or not if it's expensive or uncomfortable for you!). I'd prefer someone within a few years of my age, but gender identity and where you're from makes no difference to me.

"[2&&sleepingcoder&&POST=26/M/India Looking for penpals to share life updates.] I am an Engineer based out in India and had could access this account after a long time. Most of my work week is spent working in a corporate office and weekend is wasted sleeping or running errands. I neither have the luxury nor zeal to maintain a hobby. As every other south Indian i watch lot of movies and catch up on interesting series. I saw that i had a pen pal whom i was speaking to when i was in college and had last contacted 2 Years back. Reading all the messages made me understand how much i had grown over the years. I do write myself mails using futureme.org but i guess i could share more with an inquisitive pen pal. I may not reply frequently but, i will try to reply. I guess i crave a different perspective on me and feel like i am living inside an echo chamber. I hope my kids or grand-kids could read the messages we share when i would have been long gone.","[2&&zebflanders&& Hey! 27/f/USA also working in an office far too much to enjoy much else in life.

The name's Badger (20 years old, non-binary, from the one and only city of Milan!) and I've been itching for a new friend! I'm chronically online university student with an eclectic range of interests: I like reading (mostly fantasy and sci-fi, but recommend me any book), video games, politics, writing, anything really! I'd love a penpal from Eastern or Southeastern Asia to correspond with and share some interesting stuff about our respective cultures and lives. But really, if you're interested and thing we could be a good fit hit me up anyway! More about me: _I love animals, and have a couple in my house. You can scroll my profile for pictures of my dog and cat respectively as they are both adorable. _My favorite books of all time is the Locked Tomb saga (if you want to know more please hit me up I'm dying to talk someone's ear off about this) _I have a beautiful fountain pen that sadly I never much get to use and a lot of pretty paper to write lovely letters with! _My favorite video games include Life Is Strange, Skyrim, and RainWorld. Especially the first and last one have really had a profound impact on me (Now make a guess on which of these I wrote a fanfiction about. Come on. Bet you'll get it wrong) I like exchanging long and meaningful letters, so come at me with your weirdest niche interests or your heartfelt opinions. I don't want to tiptoe around someone hoping they won't find me too odd or intense or whatever, so I prefer to start off a little strong so the ice breaks by itself, if that makes sense?

My family, the kind hearted souls they are, were stood laughing hysterically some distance away! • I managed to half flood (accidentally, I might add) my kitchen with bubbles (yep, bubbles!).

"[16&&iveneverhadapbandj&&POST=32/M/Australia - Make up some bogus national days and let's send cards to each other] I have this diary that tells me it's soon to be 'Respect for the Aged' Day in Japan, and it gave me an idea. Let's invent our own days and send cards to each other to celebrate! Happy 'Walk on the Left Side of the Footpath' Day, friend! May your French Toast Day be scrumptious. Blessed be this fine Tip Your Cap Day. A most joyous 'Try to Do Everything Left-Handed' Day to you :) The cards are most welcome to include some chat for us to get to know one another too, of course. I just think it would be creative and fun to send silly cards to each other making up a random reason for a day. It might actually inspire me to try something new, like make French Toast!

"[7&&RedditorFor10Years&&POST=33 m UK based artist/songwriter looking for interesting, fun people to swap stories with and cultivate meaningful friendships all over the world] Hello lovely people! My name is Arthur and I love writing long and intimate letters about pretty much anything and everything. I'm currently in hospital diagnosed bi polar and I've had some wild adventures. I tried to swim to France once, I've been a gypsy slave in Catalunya, I've been in deep trouble with the mob, I've overcome serious drug problems (though I still smoke weed), I've been exhibited in a major exhibition curated by Ai Wei Wei and was almost exhibited in Milan before covid ruined everything. I've spent time travelling around Europe homeless with nothing but a backpack and a sleeping bag. I've slept in the rain, witnessed brutal murder, been gang-stalked, robbed, rolled, beaten to a pulp by police and street thugs, survived a drive by and I am grateful for it all. I believe in a higher power and I'm fascinated by tarot, numerology, astrology and anything mystical. My passions include art, music (hip hop, punk rock, soul, jazz, classical), writing (both prose and poetry), dance, Kyokushen Karate, travelling, reading (favourites include Kerouac, Bukowski, Iceberg Slim, Milan Kundera, James Joyce, Hemingway, Murakami, Herman Melville, Joseph Heller). I speak English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and basic Serbian, I like going to museums and libraries, I love world cinema, my favourite place in the whole world is the African Museum of Tervuren, Belgium, where I grew up. If you think we would gel let's make it happen!","[2&&Primary_Ad6188&& Hey Arthur! You are absolutely in a crazy magnificent way fascinating, you seems like such a special wild genuine human being, i would absolutely love to get to know you! ]"
"[1&&Yoshihiro-Kudara&&POST=23M don't click on this post!] Greetings, fellow being of the internet! Hey there I search for someone that likes to joke around and just be silly together in one moment and talk about deep philosophical topics the next moment. Maybe even go on to an adventure together I am a lover of all things anime, games, science, space, and diverse cultures. I'm like a weird blend of Sailor Moon, Filthy frank and Elon musk- I can't decide whether to transform into a cute hairy manly anime girl, eat a raw squid live on camera that I found in the sewers or try to fly to Mars but destroy a social media platform in the process But seriously, I'm on a quest to become a social worker, and I had an internship working with disabled people. And it was amazing. I'm looking to connect with other like-minded people who want to make a difference in the world and have some fun while doing it. Oh, and did I mention that I'm a music junkie? I love everything from Japanese rap to Jazz and everything in between. So if you have any recommendations, hit me up and let's talk tunes! Let's chat about the mysteries of the universe, culture, The children in your basment and the beauty of life. Bonus points if you have a weird sense of humor like mine. Looking forward to hear from you! Also don't just send a hey. Be creative! Talk about yourself. Be stupid. Be yourself! Hope to hear from you :)","[1&&Kind_Marionberry966&& Hello! 27 F. I’m not use to responding to anyone really, but we seem like we might make good friends. I too like a wide array of different things like science, gaming, philosophy, and music from all times and places. I’m really into genealogy and history recently, but my passions of study change constantly. I’m not very good at socializing (or making friends for that matter) since most of my life I’ve just done my own thing, skateboarding around and trash talking birds that look at me funny (especially geese angry face). I use to work as a hospice care nurse and a personal senior caretaker, though I’ve been looking to get into childcare or teaching since old people are stinky stuck in their ways sometimes. I also love video games and board games of all kinds since they keep my mind off of the demons that will invade one day. I also must warn up front, I don’t care for empty conversation so if I’m sent a one word message, I’ll most likely ignore it (did I do that?? laughter soundtrack) I also don’t watch much much tv or shows since I prefer to spend quality time with people, but I have been swayed to watch certain things… at least with enough sacrifices… And now I end my rant because I don’t know how to talk to people 👋🏻 good day ]"

Cheers","[1&&speakofthemfondly&& Nice to meet you! I’d love to talk to you. I’m also 28, NB from Bulgaria. Russian used to be mandatory here before but I don’t know it because of when I was born. I also like cultural exchanges and learning new things. I’d say Bulgaria is very enriched when it comes to history, due to how things have been and what we’ve been through during different periods, and our choices now. I really enjoy some Soviet antique items and collect when I get the opportunity, especially porcelain figures, postcards/artwork and books. If you would be interested, I’d love to exchange letters at some point too, but this isn’t an obligation. Do you like the movie Stalker? It’s one of the first things I think of when I hear Russia since I really like it. I also think of the vastness of nature that you have and how beautiful and diverse it is. I’d love to visit lake Baikal at some point, if it’s ever possible for me. Have you traveled within Russia? Why did you live in Czech Republic and how did you like it? I am also a very anxious person, I’m starting a new job on the 5th and im beyond myself with worry! I’ve managed to tackle my anxiety disorder to an extent, and I’d be happy to help you where I can. Despite my introverted and worried nature, I am a very curious person and may ask a lot of questions. I can be very contradicting in general. I like a lot of things but to sum up a few: animals, nature, photography, learning languages and picking up different hobbies. I enjoy travelling and hiking when I can get to do it too. Video games and movies are a must for me, even though I don’t get to play much these days, it’s still a pretty big part of my identity. I do like anime too, but I haven’t found anything I could follow lately. I’m open to suggestions! I’d love to listen to your music if you’d feel like sharing! I also enjoy reading lyrics, sometimes I’ll find a song that I love and the lyrics will always play a major role in why I like it. If it matters, I am also firmly against the war/regime. I’d describe my political stance in general as leftist. I’m LGBTQI+ friendly too. Feel free to PM me if you like my message so far! I’m currently at work so I can’t shoot a message right away but I’ll do my best to reply when I am free. Take care! Edit: ooh! Your username, that was a Czech beer, right? ]"

"[5&&EmotionalAsk3040&&POST=32/F looking for an email friend] Hello! I just painted my nails plum, and I'm reading The Dead Girls Club by Damien Angelica Walters. I have been feeling a little low lately - I feel like I'm married to my part-time job, and just trying to save money as much as I can, so maybe connecting with someone new would perk me up? I'm a 32 year old woman from Finland, and looking for a female email friend from a different country. I'd rather write longer messages less often than chat with people online. I don't care about age very much as long as you are at least in your twenties. I have been doing snail mail for almost eight years, but nowadays it's mostly digital, because the postage is so ridiculously expensive. I'd love sending postcards every now and then on the side though. I could say I like quiet life. I enjoy literature, museum visits, visiting church buildings, and if traveling was free, I would have left yesterday. I try to have a positive or at least neutral attitude, and be grateful for good things in life. I can be a very sentimental person - I have kept lots of mementos from my younger years, and like following different nostalgic accounts on social media. In the last years I have been quite passionate about genealogy and family war history research, but lately my motivation has been missing. I work as a cleaning person, and if you look at that kind of jobs down your nose, then we are not a good match :) Some small things I like: iced coffee, train trips, Moomin books, rainy summer days, watching the same tv-shows over and over again, second hand shops, stamps, and white chocolate. Feel free to send me a private message if you think we could find stuff to talk about. I can write first.",[1&&AmiCal13&& Hi! Would love to be penpals but I cant send you a message! ]

She didn’t find them and the RAC had to come the next morning to tow the car away to the dealership. A family friend then leant her a disgusting 1980’s diesel Peugeot he used for tip runs. She wasn’t used to lack of power steering and drove it into a post on the driveway, so then had to pay for a new headlight as well as a new set of keys for the VW.

Doesn't have to be eloquent prose but certainly more than one word responses. The occasional meme or gif is absolutely welcome of course.

I would love to have a penpal who I can talk to and make pretty cards for :) It's always so fun to make a nice thing, and to also get something nice back ♡ I always have so many ideas for crafts, but not a real purpose to use them on, so I think snail mail would be a great thing to keep me busy. A little bit about me: I would call myself nerdy/geeky, alternative I am hella neurodivergent and chronically ill (endometriosis/adenomyosis, PCOS, prolactinoma, suspected Ehlers-Danlos syndrome) I am Pagan/Wiccan (feel free to ask me about this :)) I love nature and animals I love spending time outside in spring and fall when my health permits it, hiking and camping is so lovely I have a lot of pets, dog, cat, snail, walking leaves, isopods, cockroaches and a lot of houseplants I also love collecting things/trinkets, I am kind of a hoarder hehe I love crafting and fiddling with things, always looking for new projects to start (and never finish oof) I am always watching series, movies or youtube My favourite bands/music: Lord Huron, Ghost, Imagine Dragons, Keane, A-ha, Taylor Swift, Foster the People, NSP/Starbomb I used to read a lot, my favourite book is Treasure Island I live in the Netherlands, but I don't mind sending letter far away if the price of stamps is reasonable I hope one of you vibes with this and wants to be friends with me Let me know if you are interested :) I don't have a preference for age or preferred pronouns (mine are she/they by the way)","[1&&illiteratelonerr&& Love making letters, 21F US lmk ! ]"

"[3&&scythe2sceptre&&POST=26 M AUS] Howdy everyone! Im looking for another pen pal! I got into postcard sending a couple years ago and its become a small source of happiness in my life. Its such a great feeling to get a postcard from somewhere else in the world! Ideally id prefer to start on just IMs so we can build a friendship and gain confidence in the security of personal details. I take personal and cyber security very seriously so I am always incredibly careful with how my personal identifying details are shared online. That being said, Ill say a bit about me! I currently work as a developer and have been trying to dedicate more of my life to work. I am diagnosed with bipolar and have been struggling with the repercussions of avoiding medication for some time now, something to likely change soon. I have a background of substance abuse so these past years have been a lot of work to better myself and keep sober. Im also a small timer streamer and have spent the past year or two building a small community of friends to hangout and chat shit with while I game. Im an avid reader; I love Tolkien and enjoy some of Murakamis works too. I also love to learn and I have a deep interest in history. I enjoy spending time in nature and I like to go camping when I can. Im a big music listener, and I mostly lean towards Metal, Old skool, 80s-90s pop, and movie scores / videogame soundtracks I like having deep conversations, I like to see how people answer difficult questions, and what makes them tick. I like to think Im a philosophical person, but maybe I just spend too much time dwelling on thoughts. Shoot me a message if youre interested :)",[1&&shansews&& Hey!

A little about me; I tried getting a penpal multiple times, but I suck at keeping track of it all and personal issues as home mess up (i'm sorry penpals from the past!), I'm 21, a trans guy so he/him pronouns please, and I hope to travel one day.

I love houseplants, fountain pens, art and art history, astrology, and cats. I'm constantly listening to music! I enjoy a little bit of everything, but my interest tends to land somewhere in the indie-rock/pop zone (currently listening to a good bit of Softcult, Dino Gala, second thoughts, and many more). I work from home in early intervention for developmental delays. I'm pretty sure I have ADHD and I've just been raw-dogging it my whole life without any assistance (would not recommend). There are a bunch of movies and shows I enjoy, but I'm currently stuck in a cycle of rewatching Heartstopper and the same 3 Studio Ghibli movies over and over again because THEY'RE JUST COMFORTING OKAY. Not sure how to end this. I guess reply or PM me if you're interested in having a rambling mess of human being as a digital penpal lol","[3&&PotatoGirl104&& Hiya! I’m not sure if I’m too old?!

A bit about me: I'm a mom, but it's not my entire life, I promise. I'm very left-learning, part of the LGBTQ, and not religious. I love houseplants, fountain pens, art and art history, astrology, and cats. I'm constantly listening to music! I enjoy a little bit of everything, but my interest tends to land somewhere in the indie-rock/pop zone (currently listening to a good bit of Softcult, Dino Gala, second thoughts, and many more). I work from home in early intervention for developmental delays. I'm pretty sure I have ADHD and I've just been raw-dogging it my whole life without any assistance (would not recommend). There are a bunch of movies and shows I enjoy, but I'm currently stuck in a cycle of rewatching Heartstopper and the same 3 Studio Ghibli movies over and over again because THEY'RE JUST COMFORTING OKAY. Not sure how to end this. I guess reply or PM me if you're interested in having a rambling mess of human being as a digital penpal lol",[2&&katbeezy&& just messaged you! ]
"[5&&ThePowerOfBC&&POST=41/m/Southeastern US - Wanna go on an adventure?] I want love. Real love built on honesty and communication and trust between two people. Something intimate and rewarding and life-affirming that other people can't quantify and label. I'm not talking about romance here, though I suppose it could end up that way. It's hard to find anything that real anymore. Western culture tries to push us into self-centered consumption. We know it's empty, but it's so hard to counter that. I often find myself describing who I am through the things I enjoy. I'm more than that. Everybody is. I want to get to know someone. No secrets. No withholding. You can't love a person without knowing what they are. Emotion without knowledge is empty, just a fantasy. I know that will take work and exploration and maybe some discomfort. There are some caveats that I should disclose before you invest your time and your self. I'm autistic. High-functioning, but still. I am awkward. Communication is not always easy. I don't always pick up on body language or subtlety in real time. I'm not dim. It's just not automatic. I have to think. I'm moody. I'm difficult to know and understand. Connection is my greatest deficit, and that is the core of my pain. My politics do not align with the majority of Reddit. I'm no political junkie, but it seems to be especially important to sectors of this platform. My politics are merely an outgrowth from my life experiences, my sense of morality, and what I consider fair. I disdain all power structures, whether governmental or corporate. I don't think anyone should have more say in my life than I do. I feel the same applies to everyone. Power always oppresses, so nobody should have it. I struggle heavily with depression and anxiety. This isn't a world for autistic people. It's loud and crowded and busy and bright. It's overwhelming for the senses and the emotions. I withdraw from it a lot, but I will always be alone if I don't try. So, here I am. If you are curious about some of the details, I have written a few different ads. I know people like to investigate before writing back, so I'll refrain from repeating myself and direct you to my post history. Ad 1 The second Number 3 Last, but not least If you like what you're reading, please write. If you stop wanting to write someday, please tell me why. I can't promise a happy ending. I can promise I'll do my best. Can you? My name is Brent, by the way. Hi.",[1&&Jolly-Catch-141&& Hello ]

"[5&&TangeloAway3919&&POST=Looking for fitness buddy] Hello! I always get into fitness kicks, but they're a purely solo venture and I find I always fizzle out after a few months. All of my other hobbies I can keep to just fine, namely because I have people to talk to. Someone to share what I drew with or to be encouraged by when I see that they made themselves practice, ect. Maybe I'm just a social creature! But it really helps for accountability. If anyone feels similar, reach out and we can brag to each other when we do one of our goals and in turn have some inspiration to follow through. Currently I'm at a 33in waist, wear an XL, and my blood work suggests I need more protein/iron without adding any cholesterol. I'm recovering from an injured stomach so I'm relearning how to eat since my signal to stop used to be physical pain the moment my stomach wasn't empty and now that it can be full, I got a little carried away with enjoying the feeling! My goals are to work out for 15-20 minutes a day, go for at least a small walk outside daily, and to work on eating better proportions with healthy additions to ease into things. In a few weeks I'd like to see myself grow as things get less hard, even if it's just a 40 minute walk daily and one intentionally healthy meal a day, or swapping out a few meals with salads. I think that kind of approach is more sustainable to me than diving in all at once! My ideal is so get stronger and to go full my current 165lbs to ~140, which sounds realistic!

"[9&&RetroNuva10&&POST=22/M/USA Looking for pen-pals to share metal music, etc.!] Hey. I'm looking for people (I don't care about age, etc.) to share music between. I'm into death and black metal primarily. I play guitar in a death metal band and have a progressive black metal solo project in the works. I'd also like to learn about different European cultures (they have some great metal scenes). I have a small CD and vinyl collection. I'm down for all formats (Reddit, email) and snail mail could be pleasant, for its connection to the early metal scene via swapping tapes, etc. Bonus points if you play an instrument.

"[9&&RetroNuva10&&POST=22/M/USA Looking for pen-pals to share metal music, etc.!] Hey. I'm looking for people (I don't care about age, etc.) to share music between. I'm into death and black metal primarily. I play guitar in a death metal band and have a progressive black metal solo project in the works. I'd also like to learn about different European cultures (they have some great metal scenes). I have a small CD and vinyl collection. I'm down for all formats (Reddit, email) and snail mail could be pleasant, for its connection to the early metal scene via swapping tapes, etc. Bonus points if you play an instrument.

"[3&&thro1234pen&&POST=36M. UK.] I am presently looking for a penpal or two. Perhaps even three. Maybe to speak with via e-mail or message regularly. Rather than writing a paragraph about what I like, don't like and what I think of my character etc etc, i'll just list some of my likes and things I am not inclined towards: Likes: Modernist Fiction and contemporary fiction (Irish renaissance FTW). Ancient literature. Art, except Medieval art which I find baffling. Ancient philosophy, occasionally. Running. Learning languages (ancient and modern). Contemporary politics and culture. Going deep into the latest literary spat (IYKYK: that profile from BI) on both sides of the pond. I love discussing poetry and art. Particularly fond of fin-de-siecle art and literature etc etc. In general I'm looking not for consistently long conversations, particularly about the above, just that we'll get on better if there's some overlap with general interests. I also like running and playing sports. International politics and the economy occasionally i'll turn towards. Oh and libraries, museums and art galleries, where I do spend as much time as I can. Things I don't care for (not a value judgement): TV, most sports but I will occasionally keep up with my local football team but less so these last few years. Movies, even though I watched the Barbie movie just to see what's up with contemporary hollywood and movies. I apologise if this comes across as prickly but thought i'd get straight to it. I am quite an indirect person usually and occasionally i'll joke a little but for the most part the above two lists/para-textual-lists describe my main interests and hobbies.

"[10&&inescannoyan&&POST=27/F/PH - looking to make friends :)] I’ve had a bit of luck with this subreddit (on my old account) in the past. However, life got in the way of penpals and I don’t know how to reconnect with them, if they’d still be open to it (any advice?) That said, since I feel I am in a better place now, handling life a little better, I would like to make new connections. :) A little about me: I am a very optimistic person (that is realistic when needed) I can be quite emotional in that I feel feelings very intensely (I’ve been called an empath in the past) I love watching video essays on film tropes, acting performances, literary tropes, genres and subgenres in film and music, fashion, the human condition, and the like I love both cats and dogs (but our place only allows cats so we only have cats) I like the horror genre in books and film (my favorite author is Stephen King) I am recently separated from my fiance of 6 years and am currently healing and finding joy in every day life :) I like all genres of music but am particularly drawn to RnB, folk, disco, jazz, and alternative rock I am big on maximalism, I dream of one day having a house with colorful witchy decor That’s about it, I guess. Please message me if you’re interested in becoming penpals. :) I’d love to hear about your passions as well! :)",[1&&peculiarcrowblob&& Want to be my new penpal? ]

"[4&&Kenoticket&&POST=25/M/USA - Looking for a penpal to talk about anything and everything with!] Hello, all! I’m hoping for a penpal to trade some long messages with. I’ve had some great email penpals in the past and miss the feeling of getting a lovely message in your inbox every so often, so that’s why I’m using this tag. But we can also do messaging on reddit if you like. I’m an introverted and somewhat shy guy, I’d much rather go on a late-night walk than go to a party. But I find it easier to get to know people through writing. I like asking questions and putting effort into the conversation. And as for some of the things I’m interested in, I enjoy history, literature, games, TV shows, museums, psychology, meditation, and movies. I like to write reviews of movies I see, and am trying to get into writing stories (though I can never figure out what to write about). But I would love to hear about any interests that you may have, whether they’re similar or different! I’m up for talking about anything. I’ve been described as patient and a good listener, so if you ever want to vent or talk about mental health struggles (or save those for when we know each other better) I’m here for you. I understand those struggles, believe me. I also don’t shy away from talking about “deep” subjects like philosophy, politics, and religion, though of course we don’t have to. If it matters, I’m politically liberal, but I’m very non-judgmental and would never reject someone based on their views. So if you’re interested in talking, feel free to send over a message! I’d love to make a friend here, but without any pressure to reply quickly. Like an email a week, for example, would be fine. Feel free to tell me about yourself, I always appreciate that in an opening message. Thanks for reading, and look forward to some penpalling!","[1&&MyLittleBucci&& Hello! I am from Spain!

"I would like to try being your pen pal. We have similar interests and I just joined this group. I feel snail mail is a very lost art and I agree, opening anything that is not a bill or trash is too exciting. I love hiking, camping, reading is my version of self care and game every now and then with my boys, no where near what I used to.",[1&&ForestPixieNymph&& Your account is very new how do I know you’re not a bot? 🤔 ]
Your account is very new how do I know you’re not a bot? 🤔,"[1&&Bookish_dreamer00&& You are correct, my account is new. I just joined this reddit thing and honest to goodness couldn’t figure out how to send a msg versus respond to the post (or if that’s even a thing). I 100% understand being leery of the scammers, lord knows they make life difficult and are a pain. I guess for this instance you would have to trust me to explain to me how to send a msg and then we could exchange emails, or some other form of contact to get to know each other a touch more. I live in the states, I am a 41F, have two boys, two dogs, 3 cats and we live in a small midwestern town. Just being brutally honest on the new to Reddit, I don’t TikTok, barely utilize social media and just want a good old fashioned pen pal. I think the art of writing letters is lost. I also collect post cards and enjoy sending them whenever I am blessed to travel. ]"

Before you decide to reply to this or DM me I'd like to share a few things about myself. I'm a Mechanical Engineer, Guitarist, Vocalist. I'm moving to Australia soon to persue my Masters degree. I started reading novels last year and I have absolutely fallen in love with it and just can't stop! I don't have a favourite author yet as I haven't read that many books yet. My favourite book till date is Silent Patient by Alex Michaelaedis and a lesser known book by an Indian author - Patang (which means kite) by Bhaskar Chattopadhyay. The latter was the first book I picked up... a murder mystery, psychological thriller that absolutely blew my mind. When I turned the last page of the book is when I realized what I had been missing out on for 21 years of my life. In terms of music, I don't have a specific taste. As a musician myself, I love listening to different kinds of genres as well as languages. If it's good music then I'll add it to my playlist lol. Looking forward to meeting some amazing people here!

"[4&&jaunepoi&&POST=31/F/US Looking for UK friends!] Hi! I'm looking for pen pals in the UK so I can make friends in a place I'd like to visit one day :) I'm from Portland, Oregon and I've sadly never traveled anywhere even though I want to. Solo travel is a bit frightening for someone who's lived in a small(ish) city all my life, so I think it would be nice to have friends there whenever I do decide to go somewhere. No preference on gender, but someone who is 27 - 37 and liberal/progressive would be nice. That being said, here's some stuff about me: I'm nerdy at heart. I love reading fantasy/sci-fi, playing video games, watching anything animated, listening to comedy podcasts. I tend to hyper-fixate on things I love for long stretches of time. Right now that would be Good Omens. Before that it was Stranger Things. Before that it was Star Trek. You get it. I went to school for design, worked as a designer for 8ish years, got burnt out, and made a career switch this year to be a UX strategist, which I now love. I have a cat named Pepsi. I'm single, queer, somewhere on the confusing middle part of the asexual spectrum, but happily living on my own. I've been learning Japanese on and off since high school, both academically and on my own. I'm rusty, so probably sitting at a N4 or N5. I was on an episode of Portlandia, which I applied to be on as a joke, but apparently my humor is too ""Portland"" so it ended up coming across as genuine. I played checkers with Fred Armisen.(Note: Everyone in Portland hates Portlandia). If you'd like to become friends please DM! I'm down for snail mail, email, anything works really. I'm new to reddit so forgive me if I misstep anywhere here.","[1&&Possibly-ACat&& Wow!

If you put on the back of the envelope ""sender: [your address]"" then I'm guessing it would get sent back if there were problems though I don't know if that works internationally or in every country. It works in the UK though.At work if someone has moved house and the new resident crosses it out and says ""does not live here"" then our company marks the database as ""dead letter office"" so we know they've moved. That's a reason to write a return address on the back of the letter, some people might be in rented accomodation and move about and not think of these things. Of course that depends on the new resident to know the above practise, which I think people don't looking at my girlfriends rented house share with a huge stack of mail for people that no longer live there... I sent something from UK to Russia (before the war sanctions and stuff) and it took a month. If I were sending to a relative I would include an email and telephone just in case they felt they couldn't find time to go to the post office or something. If it were someone else I would assume life got in the way. I think what happens is (snail mail or not) people take on too many penpals and get overwhelmed at some point for whatever reason and it can all break down. I've been there before during exams times. ]"
"[8&&beaginger&&POST=Lost in the Mail?] How often do letters really get lost in the mail? I have some penpals that I've been corresponding with for years. Meanwhile, sometimes I never hear back from a person after I've sent off the first letter. Did my letter get lost? Did they decide not to reply? Normally, I assume the latter, however a few months ago I sent a letter to a long-lost relative and I was hoping to hear back. Should I send another letter assuming the first was lost, or do I cross them off? What is the mail system in the USA like these days?","[3&&Eak-the-Cat&& Mail in the US is a bit hit-or-miss these days. I've had a couple letters returned due to ""address does not exist"" or some similar BS. Strangely, the addresses in question not only exists but I've been sending mail to and receiving mail from it for a long time now. But when I resend them, they get delivered properly. Also, transit times are a bit messed up... For example, I received a letter from the UK in 10 days (based on postmark), but it often takes letters sent from the sext state over about 20 days to be delivered (again, based on postmark). That said, I don't *think* I've had anything lost in the mail... but how would I know? LOL I think the bigger thing is just that sometimes when you're pen paling, the person receiving the letter reads it and (for whatever reason) just ends up not replying. Generally, if I'm not interested in continuing to correspond with someone, I'll let them know--politely. But I don't think that's the norm, shrug. ]"

"[3&&auryylmao&&POST=25/F/ITA Searching for a couple more penpals from Italy (I am Italian and I live in Italy!) ~ snail mail] Hello! I made a post here a couple weeks ago looking for penpals in Italy. I am still looking for a couple more people, so I thought I'd publish this again. 💖 I'm Aurora, I'm 25 years old, I live in Trentino but I'm originally from Calabria. I'm looking for pen pals around my age (I'd say from around 19 to 28 years old) who live in Italy (I don't know if it's just bad luck, but Poste Italiane often loses my letters for Europe 😅). I've had pen pals for many years, but I stopped during the pandemic and haven't really started again. Now that I've moved to a new place, I feel that getting back into it would be good for me. I'm an illustrator and graphic designer, I graduated in graphic design in 2020, so expect lots of stickers, haha! I enjoy baking cakes, knitting, drawing, and board games. I've been playing Animal Crossing forever, so if you play too, we already have a thousand things in common 😆 My introduction is pretty bad, but I swear I'm better at writing than this, haha! If you're interested, send me a message! ~ Ciao! Sono Aurora, ho 25 anni, vivo in Trentino ma sono calabrese. Sto cercando amicə di penna più o meno coetanei (direi da 19 anni a 28 circa) che abitino in Italia (non so se sia solo sfortuna, ma Poste Italiane perde quasi sempre le mie lettere destinate all'Europa 😅). Ho avuto amici di penna per tantissimi anni, ma ho smesso durante la pandemia e non ho più ricominciato sul serio. Adesso che mi sono trasferita in un posto nuovo, sento che riprendere mi farebbe bene. Sono illustratrice e graphic designer, mi sono laureata in grafica nel 2020, perciò aspettatevi molti adesivi ahah! Mi piace fare le torte, lavorare a maglia, disegnare ed i giochi da tavolo. Gioco ad Animal Crossing da sempre, se giocate anche voi abbiamo già mille punti in comune 😆 La mia presentazione fa pena, ma giuro che sono più brava di così a scrivere 😆 se siete interessatə mandatemi un messaggio!",[1&&Parlu10&& Ho mandato un DM! ]

"[6&&m1ndmelt&&POST=45M Need more female in my life (UK)] So, hard to write the title without sounding creepy or on the prowl… so here is a detailed intro. For context - I’m in a relationship and have 2 children - not looking to replace any of this. I grew up with 2 sisters and a mum, then trained as a professional that is 98% female - so have spent most of my adult life living and working with women. At uni I lived in a house with 8 women, for more context. All of my best friends have been and are women, aside from one gay man. I’ve been to so many Hen parties and been the ‘maid of honour’ more than once, lol. I’ve got more than a few women in my life I genuinely love and tell them that I love, but as deep friends and adopted siblings - who share the same sentiment back. So, why a penpal? I moved to a rural house 5 years ago - deep rural England. Leaving my entire social world behind. I’ve come to discover that the gender divide here is incredible - men stick with men and women stick with women. Most men work and most women stay at home - not to judge them, but very different to my life previous where I saw women in every walk of life. Needless to say, people react suspiciously when I automatically try to make friends with their wives etc.I’m not typical in that I am a Dr and very accomplished - but I also do most of the childcare, all of the cooking and constantly learn skills to support rural home life - from welding to horse training to sewing (badly). My poor partner has become the single source of female contact and it’s too much for her, lol. I jest, but there is some truth in it. So… in this request I am interested in linking with a woman is who likely is on the other side of this situation. In a life that has shrunk and perhaps lacks male presence, beyond perhaps immediate relationships. I know many professional women who have taken time out of careers - and feel their brains going insane! (I’ve been there also - previously a 100% single parent dad !) My interests: Psychology, dystopian fiction, horses, art, drumming, writing and meaningful relationships (in this I mean, I like to consider that people can be close in many ways and I wrote a book about relationships, so it’s a big theme for me). I’m witty and generally have a dark sense of humour. Looking for someone to email at some sensible interval - letters - with occasional chats. But developing to be a long-term friendship. Summary: Looking for an intelligent and reflective female penpal, who’s motivated to have more male conversation in her life.",[2&&OrganicAlterEgo&& I totally get this. 37/F/US.

I also like to swim, dance, travel, and doing heart-racing things like ziplining and rollercoasters.When I'm not at uni, you can bet I'll be watching a movie or completing a puzzle/sudoku or reading or having a scoop of ice-cream or hairdressing.

I've finished reading You've Lost A Lot of Blood by Eric LaRocca recently, and I really loved it!

I hadn’t done it in years, but Id love to try out being a pen-pal!! I haven’t done snailmail in a long time, so it should be pretty fun. I’m looking for preferably someone around my own age (17-19).

I’ve always been a more “jack of all trades” kind of guy. i love to read, my favorite genres are mystery, thriller, and fantasy. i recently got into doing crossword puzzles again so i’m enjoying that. Oh, I’m a little bit of a history and anthropology nerd so, i love learning new things in that field!! I play all sorts of video games, but i love story driven games the most I’d say. I also play ttrpgs, mostly Dungeons and Dragons though!!

"[3&&[deleted]&&POST=34M - Looking for a Penpal to get real with. Be ourselves and open up!] As I start a new season in my life I want to keep a journal. The thing is I have about 50 journals that have 3 days worth of writing in them and then I stop, I forget, it gets boring. I was trying to think of a new and different way to keep journaling exciting. It dawned on me it would be interesting if the journal talked back, if it gave me feedback on my life, asked me questions, if it shared its own deep dark secrets with me about what was going on in its life. So I have come here to find a penpal who is looking for something similar. Someone who wants to write back and forth with one another and treat each other like our daily journal. Maybe you are starting a new relationship, just starting college, off on a new life journey like fitness or new hobbies, and want to share that with someone. Lets be each other's journals and sounding boards. Lets get personal and real with one another. Instead of feeling like we are shouting off into the void maybe having a listening ear will be more calming and accountable. Or maybe you do just want to shout into the void, but have it yell back! I will gladly explain a bit about myself going forward, but I think part of the fun of journaling is the self discovery that goes on. I think this should be no different, that we slowly learn about each other through time, opening up new parts of ourselves in the conversation, learning new things about one another and about what is going on our lives. Having someone give you that honest truth, that complete accountability, the thoughts of a stranger are always rewarding when you feel like you can't really share things with those around you in life. Lets lock those secrets away in our penpal journals and start a new adventure together.",[1&&Dat_Boysenberry3160&& This sounds like it would be fun! ]

"[8&&good_compass&&POST=36M | USA | This isn’t my main account…] Hey everyone. This isn’t my main account. I’m going through a divorce so I spun up a burner to give penpals a try last week. I haven’t talked to many folks yet but have enjoyed getting to connect with people from all walks of life. Part of this new chapter of my life includes a promise to myself to be more social and outgoing. I’m doing this IRL but I’m already on Reddit a bit and figured this could be a cool way to explore that. This has been a trying season for sure. But I’m excited about all that life has to offer and what new possibilities can mean. I’m a huge believer in a “growth mindset”. I really try and apply that to all areas of my life. Professionally, I work mainly in marketing but I also code and do data work. I build websites as well, sometimes. I also do a fair amount of design work. Design is something I am super passionate about and look forward to developing more skills there. Naturally, I’m a big fan of all things art. In my free time I really love to travel. Big mountains guy, skiing and summer. I go to NYC a couple times a year, which is my jam. I try and stay fit and really enjoy eating healthy. I like to cook but simple stuff. I make really good air fried salmon, steaks, veggies, and anything breakfast. I really enjoy yoga and do a lot of that as well as hiit in my garage gym. I play video games. Been going real hard in the paint on TOTK 🐐. I like movies a lot. I go with friends to see older movies at a local theater when they play them. I’m huge into music. I’ve played guitar for ~22 years and I should be better but it’s great. I play piano and sing as well and mess around in ableton. My faith is super important to me but I’m super into science and its wonders as well. I think most people treat these as exclusive of one another (thank Big Church), which I think is a shame. Reddit’s always been a place that I’ve found a lot of shared thoughts and feelings. I hope to share parts of life with some of you. Cheers.",[1&&OddLoss3221&& I'm glad you have your freedom back ]
I'm glad you have your freedom back,"[1&&good_compass&& Ya, that’s something to be grateful for now that you mention it. ]"
"[7&&[deleted]&&POST=34 M USA - A Penpal Journal or a Journal that Talks Back] As I start a new season in my life I want to keep a journal. The thing is I have about 50 journals that have 3 days worth of writing in them and then I stop, I forget, it gets boring. I was trying to think of a new and different way to keep journaling exciting. It dawned on me it would be interesting if the journal talked back, if it gave me feedback on my life, asked me questions, if it shared its own deep dark secrets with me about what was going on in its life. So I have come here to find a penpal who is looking for something similar. Someone who wants to write back and forth with one another and treat each other like our daily journal. Maybe you are starting a new relationship, just starting college, off on a new life journey like fitness or new hobbies, and want to share that with someone. Lets be each other's journals and sounding boards. Lets get personal and real with one another. Instead of feeling like we are shouting off into the void maybe having a listening ear will be more calming and accountable. Or maybe you do just want to shout into the void, but have it yell back! I will gladly explain a bit about myself going forward, but I think part of the fun of journaling is the self discovery that goes on. I think this should be no different, that we slowly learn about each other through time, opening up new parts of ourselves in the conversation, learning new things about one another and about what is going on our lives. Having someone give you that honest truth, that complete accountability, the thoughts of a stranger are always rewarding when you feel like you can't really share things with those around you in life. Lets lock those secrets away in our penpal journals and start a new adventure together.",[1&&DeadXDove&& Message me I would love to be a part of this! ]

Nothing contagious, just genetics. Some things about me... I studied animation, graphic design, and photography in college. I live in the Midwest, and I have a cat! 😄 There are many things I like, such as: • Reading (novels, webtoons, manga, etc) • Junk Journaling and Penpals • Tea, Coffee, etc • Cute things, Sweets, Make Up, Perfume/Cologne • I collect stationary (and tend to send samples in my letters) as well as pins, crystals, and any letters I may receive • Casual games: Genshin Impact, Honkai Star Rail, Minecraft, Cozy games in general I've tried using a forum to find a penpal (I believe it was Penpal Palooza..?), but I seem to only ever get one response in the mail if I'm lucky. I'm hoping to find at least one or more penpals that are willing to exchange letters.

"[12&&YesButActuallyTrue&&POST=29/M/UK - I asked my friends for a review of me to put in my message. The first one said ""8/10, would friend again."" They all then decided to unionise. They demanded chocolate, zoo trips, and mandatory hugs. Please send help. They have me outnumbered. I'm surrounded on all sides. It might be too la-] In just over a month, I turn 30. It's looking like I might be homeless and unemployed. This is where, in the biopic there will be a record scratch, a freeze frame, and the cursed words ""I bet you're wondering how we got here"" and then we zoom back through in a fancy reverse-motion-shot that they spent all the CGI budget on. If you're wondering why a biopic requires a CGI budget, don't worry - I am too. I'm slightly concerned about what is coming up for me next and somewhat hoping that it is neither the apocalypse nor an alien invasion of the planet. Both seem rather cataclysmic and frankly I would rather not be around for either of those. Ahem. I'm getting off the point. I'm supposed to be spending the CGI budget on a montage. And by montage I mean ""a list of things that you could ask me about, if you were so inclined, and wanted to save me from the contemplation of mortality that accompanies an indefinite period of instability in your personal life."" After a lot of hard work and the awfulness of doing it during COVID, I just got awarded my Ph.D. ; I shall be granted the fancy shower cap of wisdom in a couple of weeks. Alas, no photos - the graduation ceremony is in December. I'll stick a photo on the Christmas card (if I have a permanent address by then). My Ph.D. was in sound and music for virtual reality. It's 100,000 words long. You can ask about it, but I'm a researcher. A friend of mine also on the Ph.D. grind affectionately refers to all researchers as ""feral"". I will talk about it. At length. I might even tie you to the chair so you can't escape. There will be questions after. You could ask me about something less radical first, like pineapple on pizza, or socks and sandals, or which Spider-Man film is best. (Please don't ask me about Spider-Man films, I actually have no idea. I write Spider-Man fanfic, but haven't watched any of the films in years. Don't tell me readers. They haven't realised yet. Doc Ock is the best villain, but that's about the limits of my knowledge.) Prior to and simultaneous to the Ph.D., I taught music (mostly instrumental) in high schools for a decade. I was winding my career up the last few years and finally gave up the last bit of my career teaching music in July because frankly I was about to either murder every school administrator within 20 miles of London, try to burn down the Houses of Parliament, and/or throw myself out of an aeroplane in the hopes that I might get impaled by the Shard on my way down. All of my ex-employers have, at some point in the last two months, rung me to ask if I'm really sure that I'm not coming back because they don't like the look of their latest batch of applicants. It's flattering, but no. Please no. Please stop asking. I will summon Elder Gods to consume your kin. Alongside working a full-time job and doing full-time doctoral research, I somehow also found time to launch a fandom/fanfic Discord, write half a million words of fanfic, publish half-a-dozen research papers, travel to America and Canada and some bits of Europe, speak about internet censorship(!!) in Hong Kong (!!!!) in the middle of their totally-not-a-civil-war-dont-know-what-you-mean (Health and Safety banned me from going, I had to do it remotely. Killjoys, I tell you, killjoys!) and ran a video game community. At this point, we can zoom back - CGI style - to where I am spinning rotisserie style above the abyss as I shoot at least ten job applications a week into orbit. I'm trying to get into academia, publishing, or what I'm affectionately referring to as ""corporate bullshitting"" - consulting, lobbying, that kind of thing. Everyone tells me that it will happen. I have about 6 weeks, and then my financial situation becomes desperate. Maybe I could cut back on the CGI budget? In any case, I'm looking for people to send me emails to stave off what I can only describe as mind-numbing, soul-destroying, overwhelming boredom. I will take emails from anyone over 18 (because having spent the last 10 years teaching people under 18, I would like a break. Sorry!), anywhere in the world. If you're interested, ask for my email in a DM and I'll send it, and then you can send me a whole email of your own! If you're new to penpalling, that's fine - just be aware that penpalling requires a transaction of information. I tell you about my plans for world domination and having a dinosaur-themed Christmas tree, and you tell me why you only wear odd socks and how your cat is secretly the tooth fairy. Some prompts (if you want some more help): What's the truth behind the embarrassing story that your best friend tell about you whenever they meet your latest romantic partner? Why did you make that difficult decision in your life, and why don't you regret it? Do you prefer your children boiled in a stew or deep-fried? What's your favourite urban myth about your home town and why is it absolutely true? Your best friend gets to make three wishes on your behalf - no conferring allowed. Tell me why the CGI budget is so high for the disaster that will inevitable ensue. Normal messages that just tell me about you are, of course, also appreciated. PS: The length of this message is, in fact, indicative of the kind of emails I send. I can't help it. You are forewarned. And encouraged to reciprocate. PPS: I sometimes consider snail mail in normal times, but I'm literally sleeping on couches all over the world for the indefinite future. If I have a permanent address by Christmas, I will offer what has become my traditional Christmas card exchange to anyone from the internet that I talk to. So, email only for this round, I'm afraid!",[1&&Bloodmoon369&& Sent you a message! ]

"[3&&pschutt&&POST=27/M an introduction hastily thrown together during my lunch break.] Hi there, been meaning to post another ad on this sub for a while, since I got to meet some lovely people whom I've unfortunately lost contact with, partly due to laziness on my end (I'm sorry). Writing is hard, and writing honestly — which I guess is the whole point of this — takes effort. But I still found it very fun when I snail-mailed. So I figure what the hell, I'm less busy now at work, so why not give it a try once again? ABOUT ME: I'm a male, nearing my 30s. I work as a journalist and am based in Atlantic Canada (though how long this is true remains to be seen). My parents have been visiting for the last six months or so from my home country, which is in Latin America. My younger brother lives with me. He just graduated from uni. He's good at video games and plays lots. God bless him. I'm half-Chinese. My mother language is Spanish. I'm currently planning a vacation to Spain/U.K. to visit friends around Christmastime. Maybe I'll see other parts of Europe. Never visited. STUFF I LIKE: I used to read lots, but don't think that's the case anymore. Just finished that Vargas Llosa book, Conversacion en La Catedral. Currently reading Jude the Obscure. Thinking of starting a Nabokov, whom I have never read. Like histories too. Recently finished an introductory book on the history of India. Big country. Who would've thunk it... Mostly watching films now. My way to wind down when I'm not entertaining the house guests. Have a decent collection of Criterion blu-rays, which is where my money went post-pandemic (I'm bad with money). Am working my way through the Bergman boxset. Just rewatched Through A Glass Darkly a couple days ago. Favourite directors are Yang, Ozu, Kieslowski and Kiarostami. Favourite writer is Proust. Poetry I don't know much, but I like Stevens for English, and Vallejo for Spanish. I can read French and Italian, I know some Cantonese (and about 1,000+ Chinese characters, but I still don't understand a dang thing). Am also learning Russian. I like languages. It's what I do in my free time. Listen to all sorts of music. But based on Spotify listens, Mountain Goats is probably my favourite. I need a hobby that requires me to actually do something with my hands. I used to doodle. I used to play table tennis and did fencing. Now, I mostly jog on a treadmill and daydream about picking up a musical instrument. Ohh and besides literature and film and such, I also like fun. Listen to lots of improv. Big fan of any Scott Aukerman podcast project. Big fan of Tim Robinson, Joe Pera, Nathan Fielder, others. WHAT I WILL TALK ABOUT IN MY LETTERS: I dunno. Stuff that happens. I will do my best to keep letters at a reasonable length. I will also do my best to send replies in a timely manner. I hope you, my pen pal, also tell me about stuff that happens in your life! It's always nice to learn about the lives of others. We don't have to be alike to get along. I think everyone has something interesting to share! Eventually, I hope to find some long-lasting friendships. But if that doesn't work out, that's alright. Either way if I seem like a person you'd get along with, send me a message :) -pschutt",[1&&SameCamel8605&& Hey I want to by your friend! :D ]

"[1&&Logical_General_1744&&POST=27/M/FR looking for exchanges and written travels] Hello there,Have you ever travelled through letters? ""Well yeah, that's what most people use postcards for"", some of you would say.And even though I used to travel with my parents when I was a kid, I realize I never had the opportunity to keep contact with anyone from these parts of the world.And so, with work and more responsibilities, less time to travel, but the desire remains. This is the first time I have looked for penpals. I only barely remember sending letters to old friends who would have moved away with time. As for me, I work in sound. Foley, field recording, sound design, music.I spend most of my time in my studio or out doing recordings. Kinda wish and wait for the time I'll be able to travel to capture new sounds. And also to see a more of the world again. On another note, I love nature, being around it and learning about it.I started herbalism a few years back to try and cure some of the ailments I had at the time. I also do a lot of bird watching (even though I don't often get their names right). My job also helps me keep some sort of record of the sounds of nature, and how it evolves with time. I can definitely share some sound stories from time to time. I always enjoy sharing or receiving experiences about nature and places in general. Pretty naturally I love music and art in general. I've been playing guitar/piano since I was a kid and always try to learn and play new ones when I can find some in a flea market or garage sale (which are also the places where I find most of the objects I use for work too). Still, it's not all that serious.If you have an interest in anything related to games or mangas I would love to share some of my latest finds (I swear it's also research for my job),I'm trying to get back into litterature too. I mainly enjoy writers like Pratchett, Lovecraft, Hobb and some others for english-speaking writers. Otherwise, I am still trying to get back to Zola, Maupassant or Vernes lately. Still, even as a French some of these are hard to read sometimes. But to be fair, as much as I want to share mine, I want to read stories.Stories about places and people. Talking from time to time about vivid memories or funny daily occurrences. About dilemmas and relief.I also want to read and learn about customs and legends from other countries. Tales of old and conflicts that shaped history. Damn, that sounds way more pompous than intended.Well they said to try to tell a story, but it's been a long time since I wrote to anyone, so please bear with me.If anyone is interested in sharing stories, I would prefer to start by using mail, since I'm moving soon. If we keep in contact, I'll make sure to start sending letters or snail mails (and why not add some handmade stuff as well, even if I'm not that good at it). Hope to talk to you later(Also sorry for my French, and the typos)",[1&&MeMikkoandI&& I’d be happy to connect. I’ve just sent you a DM :-) ]

I am currently not schooling and am doing a part time job, but will be back on a schooling program next year if everything goes well. I am one with many hobbies, but my main focus is in the arts, crafting and collaging. I also like to travel and explore the world bit by bit and doing Postcrossing has allowed me to expand my world view as well. Sometimes, I read too.

I used to exercise lots and hope to get back to it some day. Haha, if the motivation ever kicks in. I like to cook and try food from different cultures. And I like comedic shows the best. My favourite colour is forest green and I like to eat mint chocolate chip ice cream. Hmmm… what else? I also collect and use stationeries!

I just signed up to Reddit because I wanted to look for a pen pal, preferably one from an english speaking country or one who doesn't speak spanish as their first language.

I want to exchange weekly emails and maybe letters with someone who is okay with not revealing our full names, social media or identity, at least at first.

If the person who wants a pen pal does not have the incentive to be personally engaged in the looking how could anyone expect a real invested pen pal? I have replied to a number of these requests over the years and none of them ever worked out. It takes two people who are serious and willing to do the work to make it work.

"[10&&RemarkableSpeaker850&&POST=27M/Australia - Looking to make some long term friends from around the world!] Hello everyone! I'm looking to find some long term pen pals, ideally people from outside Australia (but if this post resonates with you feel free to get in touch regardless). I've had great experiences with pen pals in the past and in general I enjoy hearing about the unique experiences everyone has in their own lives. Where I live in Australia, it often feels pretty isolated from the rest of the world, and I'd love to talk to people with diverse perspectives! A bit about me; I'm someone that has a lot of interests, but the one thing I'm most passionate about is rock climbing. Being a climber, over the years I've fallen in love with a lot of similar outdoor activities, like hiking & camping. As much as I get so much enjoyment being surrounded by nature, I'm also a nerd at heart and I'm into most things Sci-fi/fantasy related. That includes TV shows/movies, games, science, and pondering all of life's big questions. Emailing back and forth would work best for me, so if that sounds good to you please feel free to send me a message and we can exchange emails :)","[1&&silver_opal&& I there, 32F from Brazil… email would be great, DM if interested. ]"

I'll try and keep this concise as I have a habit of rambling on sometimes. I'm 31 and I live in the East of England, sandwiched between Norwich and Ipswich. I'm not from this part of the country originally though, so I'm sorry to say that I don't have six toes. Your search will have to go on! I've tried many apps in attempting to fill the void of friendships lost, including Slowly, Interpals and many others, but to no avail. What I'm looking for is something very specific.

I have met people on Reddit before and I value them hugely, but we don't talk as often as I would like. I don't want to lose them though, I just accept that we have a sort of penpalesque friendship. I also have my guy mates that I talk to from time to time, so I'm ideally looking for a girl best friend here to vary things up a little! I'd love to find someone who's naturally very open and is capable of keeping a conversation moving. I realise not everyone is capable of being very open from the start, but I've always found it far easier to get along with someone when you're both open - and to an extent, vulnerable - with each other and you don't speak as if you're withholding things about yourself. You don't need to know how to start the conversation; a simple 'how are you?' is perfectly fine. I just want someone who really makes an effort to talk! 😊 Tell you what, to set the tone, why don't you ask me something pretty personal as an icebreaker? You'll probably want to know a bit about me, so here you go: What I love: Photography (both film and digital) Football Cricket Talking about general life stuff Journalling Rum My ghost mantis, Autumn ❤️ All Scottish accents Bluey-purple What I don't love: Grapefruit Being too warm Loud people I don't care where you're from, what your skin tone is or anything like that.

"[2&&Ok-Marionberry-1455&&POST=30/F/Philippines Seeking for nice and cool Penpals for Casual Conversations and Meaningful Exchanges] Hey there, fellow Redditors! I hope this post finds you all in great spirits. 😊I'm on the lookout for some awesome penpals who are interested in engaging conversations and genuine connections. Now, before anyone gets the wrong idea, let me make it clear: I'm not here to find a romantic relationship. Nope, not my cup of tea! What I'm really excited about is finding like-minded individuals who are up for some good ol' fashioned sharing and caring. A little about me: I'm 30|F| Lives in Manila, Philippines who's passionate about exploring the world through words. I believe that every day holds a story worth sharing, whether it's about the crazy morning commute, the delightful surprise of stumbling upon a hidden bookstore, or the hilarious mishap that turned an ordinary day into an unforgettable adventure. I've got a bookshelf full of novels waiting to be read, and I'm always on the lookout for recommendations and discussions about the latest literary gems. What I'm looking for are penpals who enjoy light-hearted conversations about life's ups and downs. Let's chat about the simple pleasures like a warm cup of coffee on a rainy day, the excitement of discovering a new hobby, or the quirky habits that make us who we are. If you've got a fun story, a random thought, or even a book you can't stop raving about, I'm all ears (or rather, eyes)! So, if you're someone who's up for friendly banter, thoughtful exchanges, and simply sharing the joys and curiosities of life, I'd love to connect with you. Let's keep the chats interesting, the laughter flowing, and the connection real. Feel free to drop me a message or leave a comment, and let's embark on this.","[1&&Intelligent-Primary8&& Hey, I am 21 years old. I am a guy from India.

"[11&&penguinicequeen&&POST=Austria - Pen Pal? Is this you?] Hey everyone! I got this amazing postcard from my pen pal in Austria (met via this thread), but there is no return address. I can't find my chat thread either! Does this post card sound familiar? Could this be you? Please reach out! I'm eager to respond to my newfound pen pal :) It was sent out priority mail in July 19, 2023 at 16:35 from Gmund, Niederösterreich, Austria. It also says in the right hand corner: Bar Freigemacht Postage Paid Österreich Austria The postcard talks about how handwriting may be hard to read because it's cursive (it's readable haha). The pen pal shared that they studied in Vienna. They also asked me to know more about me! If this might be you, please reach out! I want to respond :) I already have the letter written out and all, only to figure out that I don't have a return address! Below is my original post if that helps you figure out if you sent this post card from Austria! Hello hello :) I'm going to try this again! I am looking to add more people to my snail-mail pen pal list!

"[4&&peace_of_the_woods&&POST=27/F/USA - would love to make friends all over the country and, if possible, the world!] Last time I tried this, life went off the deep end, but things are much more stable now! Only... I still have no friends. Some things that are interesting about me: I play the harp. I'm into progressive and symphonic metal, grunge rock, melodic/deep techno & trance, classical music, and others. One of my goals for the future is to get an electric harp and use it to make harp rock/metal. (Yes, really.) I dream of starting a band or small ensemble. My favorite authors include Nabokov, Kafka, and Murakami, and I'm also a huge fan of Gothic horror and magic realism. I've never been a big TV/movie/anime watcher, but I'm totally open to recommendations of the series or movies that people think are ""must-watch"" touchstones, so that I can increase my own cultural knowledge and get out from under this rock. I am also just getting into personal finance / investing. I dance (ballroom, a little bit of ballet, want to learn to shuffle) and I dabble a little in calligraphy on the side. I work in substance use treatment and have a lot of thoughts about addiction, mental health, and society in general. I've worked with all kinds of people in this field and strive to be as empathetic, compassionate, and non-judgemental as possible. Also I have been through and hopefully am on the other side of some major mental health struggles myself. I would prefer longer form snail mail, but I will also do email if that is more accessible. Also, I'm currently in Florida but looking to move in the spring to either the Twin Cities or upstate NY, so let me know if you're from either of these areas. Extra bonus points if I can practice my French with you! Please send a message if you're interested!",[1&&DahliaFleur&& Hey there!

"[6&&Pale-Charge-5343&&POST=26/M/Japan] I’m from India but I’ve been living in Japan for the past few years. I moved here right after college for my first job and have been here since. I’m a pretty huge bookworm and I love Fantasy and Fiction. In fact, the reason I was interested in writing letters again is because I recently read The Name of the Wind I really miss writing letters. It’s been so long and there’s just something relaxing about putting your thoughts on paper. If you are interested in getting to know each other please feel free to reach out!","[1&&snlnkrk&& I would love to send you letters. A while ago I did a ""dual-letter"" type - I sent a book review alongside an ordinary letter! However, I think it was too long, and my penpal never replied to me. Such a shame. If you'd be interested in talking about books & our thoughts about them then I'd gladly volunteer as your penpal. ]"

Ya depending on the country your penpal would have to pay the same if not more to receive it and it made me feel like an ass after I sent one package that cost almost a hundred USD to send. What I started doing was either sending them the money via penpal or whatever their local currency is to cover it for them. But for me I’m able to do that if not you might be in more of a tight spot. I don’t know if this helped but let me know if you find another solution!,[2&&Lildevil4ever18&& My solution was sticking to US and Canadian penpals. It sounds racist but right now I don't have the funds. ]

I often share my creations on Reddit, fostering connections with artists from diverse backgrounds. Based in the States, I currently have a fulfilling role where I assist artists in showcasing their work and securing new residencies. Despite this, I've found my surroundings somewhat lackluster and crave genuine connections that unfold organically, devoid of biases. In search of a pen pal, I envision exchanging letters and art packages, engaging in unhindered discussions about the world, all free from judgment.

"[10&&Kenoticket&&POST=25/M/USA - Looking for a penpal to have deep conversations with!] Hello, all! I’m hoping for a penpal to trade some long messages with. I’ve had some great email penpals in the past and miss the feeling of getting a lovely message in your inbox every so often, so that’s why I’m using this tag. But we can also do messaging on reddit or elsewhere if you like. I’m an introverted and somewhat shy guy, I’d much rather go on a late-night walk than go to a party. But I find it easier to get to know people through writing. I like asking questions and putting effort into the conversation. And as for some of the things I’m interested in, I enjoy history, literature, games, TV shows, museums, psychology, meditation, and movies. I like to write reviews of movies I see, and am trying to get into writing stories (though I can never figure out what to write about). But I would love to hear about any interests that you may have, whether they’re similar or different! I’m up for talking about anything. I’ve been described as patient and a good listener, so if you ever want to vent or talk about mental health struggles (or save those for when we know each other better) I’m here for you. I understand those struggles, believe me. I love having deep conversations, including controversial things like politics and religion. Though of course we don’t have to touch those if you don't want to. If it matters, I’m politically liberal, but I’m very non-judgmental and would never reject someone based on their views. So if you’re interested in talking, feel free to send over a message! I’d love to make a friend here, but without any pressure to reply quickly. Like an email a week, for example, would be fine. Feel free to tell me about yourself, I always appreciate that in an opening message. Thanks for reading, and look forward to some penpalling!",[1&&Chimoishere&& you seem like a lovely person ;) ]

"[10&&boilingpatatas&&POST=34F Longwinded, Letter-writing, Terrible Jokes Connoisseur with a LOT of Stationery] Hi there to ANYONE from ANYWHERE! Writing long letters is very much my jam. It's also my marmalade. My confit, my conserve. Well, well - look who's made herself hungry. Unfortunately, I have now written to everyone I can possible think of and have ran out of friends (a.k.a unsuspecting letter-receivers) to write to or subjects to discuss. Soooo much stationery, so little recipients. I adore collecting postcards, notes, even those tiny birthday tags that come with presents. Can we sentimental souls just unite, please? I also love creative writing even though I couldn't write my way out of a paper bag. That being said, I am also down to clown at writer-town! Ultimately, I just miss the feeling of old-timey paper smells and having creative, expressive exchanges. I miss sitting at cafes and truly putting in the time to make something for someone at the end of my letters. Passions lie anywhere between collecting and identifying flowers, tea-tasting, the history of pigments and colour (you'll understand why eventually) and how our brains work. Fine with any gender, location, age (the closer to my age and upwards the better) and I'm not particular about the frequency of our exchanges (life gets busy and it makes for better stories in our letters!)- but do know that if I consider you a friend, I care about your wellbeing and if you've gone off the grid for good. It's totally fine if you've decided to go Bear Grylls (or a less intense version) on life, but please let me know! Other than that, I am totally fine with snail mail/postcards when we can! Ok buuuddy (yes, I'm an Old Time Hawkey fan), let's pop open a cold one and get to writing!",[2&&FulaniQueen&& Hi! I'm 34/F/USA. I love decorating my letters and stationery.

"[10&&boilingpatatas&&POST=34F Longwinded, Letter-writing, Terrible Jokes Connoisseur with a LOT of Stationery] Hi there to ANYONE from ANYWHERE! Writing long letters is very much my jam. It's also my marmalade. My confit, my conserve. Well, well - look who's made herself hungry. Unfortunately, I have now written to everyone I can possible think of and have ran out of friends (a.k.a unsuspecting letter-receivers) to write to or subjects to discuss. Soooo much stationery, so little recipients. I adore collecting postcards, notes, even those tiny birthday tags that come with presents. Can we sentimental souls just unite, please? I also love creative writing even though I couldn't write my way out of a paper bag. That being said, I am also down to clown at writer-town! Ultimately, I just miss the feeling of old-timey paper smells and having creative, expressive exchanges. I miss sitting at cafes and truly putting in the time to make something for someone at the end of my letters. Passions lie anywhere between collecting and identifying flowers, tea-tasting, the history of pigments and colour (you'll understand why eventually) and how our brains work. Fine with any gender, location, age (the closer to my age and upwards the better) and I'm not particular about the frequency of our exchanges (life gets busy and it makes for better stories in our letters!)- but do know that if I consider you a friend, I care about your wellbeing and if you've gone off the grid for good. It's totally fine if you've decided to go Bear Grylls (or a less intense version) on life, but please let me know! Other than that, I am totally fine with snail mail/postcards when we can! Ok buuuddy (yes, I'm an Old Time Hawkey fan), let's pop open a cold one and get to writing!",[1&&Jinkykirby&& Hello! I've sent you a private message :) 27/F/Australia - also interested in all of the sentimental stuff and long letters ! Hope to hear from you soon. ]
"[8&&Neither-Platypus-591&&POST=47/f/usa] Hiya! Editing to say, I’ve found 3 penpals, so not needing anymore😔 But we could do something called a round Robin letter. Each person writes and adds theirs to the envelope and then sends it one to the next person in the group. When it makes it back to you, you remove your letter pics… and add a new one. If people are interested in that a group of like 6-12 max could be fun. If we get enough people in the comments, let’s do it! I’m looking for you💛👋🏻. (friendship) I love getting hand written mail. I’m looking to learn and connect through our lived experiences. I don’t care your age, location or hobbies. I’m interested in hearing all about your world. Me: married 28 years - yes crazy long! 🍀 got lucky at 19- too young, lucky. I’ve only traveled in the US mostly a couple times to Mexico (barely - super touristy areas) and Canada a few times- less than 1 week cumulative time in Canada. We have a son who can’t fly on planes yet, (wheelchair user) and I am excited to travel, hopefully sooner than later. So, anything about where you’re from especially outside USA, I’d love to hear about it. Music - DnB , K-pop, pop music, specifically TayTay, classical music - basically most music if I didn’t know it or like it before, I would give it a listen if it’s your passion and you shared why. I am mom to Smokey - 13 and Bear - 4 our adopted kitties and our 3 grown human kids. 23-28. They keep me young and learning. I see all the 20 year olds posts and I enjoy so much of what they enjoy! BUT, video games are my nemesis! I cannot!!! get my left and right hands to cooperate to play video games. It’s super annoyitating.(annoying and irritating)🫤 weird brains are weird. Just learning about fountain pens, my new hobby. I’m passionate about metaphysics, psychology, astrology, lay physics, especially astrophysics. Neuroscience (lay)… Books- probably my favorite “western classic” is Anna Karenina by Tolstoy. I don’t have a true favorite book but I enjoy witty books, clever mysteries, teen fiction, fantasy, fascinating biographies, cookbooks, etc. For work I’m an astrologer with a PhD in Metaphysical sciences. I enjoy learning about cultures and societies different then mine. Mythologies or archetypes - western astrology is based on Greek/Roman myths but I would love to learn about South American, African, Asian mythologies I don’t know much if any. New Zealander Or Hawaiian, Zimbabwean or Peruvian, if you have folk tails or myths they fascinate me. If you’re still here, you’re probably a person who could connect with me via snail mail. If you’re interested comment and let’s connect.","[2&&flzapped&& OH BOY! Saw the comment about fountain pens. You have just jumped into a rabbit hole from which there is no escape. Yup, new pens await, gallons of ink to swim in, fancy stationery that is FP friendly. Oh yeah.... ]"

(I'm planning on moving up from Texas to Winnipeg, to move in with my lovely partner and her three fur babies, within the next few months!) I'm currently trying not to melt here with this damn heat dome after spending two beautiful years living in Colorado. Here's some more things about me! I've got a degree in theatre with a concentration in stage management; while I'm not actively working in the industry right now, I can't wait to go back! I'm always down to talk about theatre, especially the tech side. I LOVE fountain pens! I only recently started actually acquiring them, but I've been lurking on the fringes of the community for a while! As a former gifted kid in recovery, I'm slowly working my way back up to reading as voraciously as I did as a grade school student. I'm mainly into LGBTQ+ fiction (happy endings ALWAYS preferred), but anything with an intriguing enough plot will probably end up on my to-be-read list. I'm a ~cozy gamer~ with a lifelong devotion to games like Harvest Moon and Stardew Valley. I'll get sucked into playing those for hours. Dungeons & Dragons has its own special place in my heart.

I've recently been on a bit of a personal journey in terms of my neurodiversity. Mental health was ALWAYS something openly talked about when I was a kid, but I didn't get diagnosed with ADHD until early last year. And boy, what a difference it makes, using strategies to handle the challenges I've faced literally every day of my life that I just thought were ""part of being functional""!

"[3&&Straight-Debate-1851&&POST=22|F|US - looking for international female pen pals of similar age] Hello internet! Just like you, I am looking for a pen pal! I am hoping to find a pen pal who is also around my age and gender who is international! I recently moved and am opening a new chapter in life: adulting (wowwww). No one tells you how lonely it is to try to become an adult in a new place. Anyways, I am hoping to find someone to call a friend as those are far and few right now. Enough with the pity party though. Here's a little about me: I am 22 years old and currently entering my first year of graduate school. I'm really excited because school is starting soon but I am also away from my family which is hard. Oh, just so I am clear, I live in the US! Some of my interests: I am really big into fiber arts (primarily crocheting, but I've tried knitting). I make stuff all the time and maybe if we become pen pals, we can exchange handmade items! I am really big into media (tik tok, movies, tv) and I like to stay up to date on celebrity stuff (I don't believe in parasocial relationships with celebrities but I'm also human). I really like YouTube. Some of my favorite youtubers are Annika's leaf, tasting history with max miller and bailey sarian. Right now, I'm rewatching grey's anatomy. I've watched up to season 15 but stopped because it was becoming too much. Some of my favorite movies are the pale blue eye, ruby sparks, uptown girls, august: Osage county, Howls moving castle, and little miss sunshine. I really like true crime and forensics. In undergrad I went to school for psychology. I like to analyze people in my life and understand how they work lol. I often contemplate my own existence and have been re-evaluating religion. But don't worry, I'm not drab, I'm just a Gemini. Hopefully, my sometimes-dry humor and Gemini tendencies don't scare you away. Underneath, I really just want to connect with someone. If my post intrigues you at all, even if you aren't necessarily my age, please reach out. For now, it'll just be my cat and I waiting for a response. Edit - I was going to end my post there but apparently you need 500 words to post on this thread. This is me attempting that. I'll tell you a story since I can't seem to get to the 500 words. When I was a kid, I desperately longed to be older. I am the youngest of my siblings and always envied my sisters for being older. I wished for a younger sibling just so I wouldn't be the youngest anymore. When I reached high school, all I could think was ""I can't wait to leave"". Eventually, when high school ended, and I attended college I thought "" I can't wait for this to be over"". Now at age twenty-two, I am in graduate school and all I can say now is ""I'm not ready"". When I was a child, I wished and wished to be older. I fantasized about the day I could have my own house, my own car, my own life. My parents always told me ""Enjoy your youth while it lasts"". I had no idea what they meant. Now, I look back to my previous years and so wish that I could go back and appreciate them more. Now I sit with memories of a childhood uncherished. But I am trying to take that back. I'm not saying I won't grow up but there will always be that smaller version of myself who deserves to be a kid. Hopefully, in finding a pen pal, I can regain a sense of naivety that I once lost. Also, I really love the Tinkerbelle series so if I can't honor the small child in me through this, I will always have Tinkerbelle lolz.","[2&&Technical-Compote519&& Hi I’m available for snail mail if you are.

Some of my favorite movies are the pale blue eye, ruby sparks, uptown girls, august: Osage county, Howls moving castle, and little miss sunshine. I really like true crime and forensics. In undergrad I went to school for psychology. I like to analyze people in my life and understand how they work lol. I often contemplate my own existence and have been re-evaluating religion. But don't worry, I'm not drab, I'm just a Gemini. Hopefully, my sometimes-dry humor and Gemini tendencies don't scare you away. Underneath, I really just want to connect with someone. If my post intrigues you at all, even if you aren't necessarily my age, please reach out. For now, it'll just be my cat and I waiting for a response. Edit - I was going to end my post there but apparently you need 500 words to post on this thread. This is me attempting that. I'll tell you a story since I can't seem to get to the 500 words. When I was a kid, I desperately longed to be older. I am the youngest of my siblings and always envied my sisters for being older. I wished for a younger sibling just so I wouldn't be the youngest anymore. When I reached high school, all I could think was ""I can't wait to leave"". Eventually, when high school ended, and I attended college I thought "" I can't wait for this to be over"". Now at age twenty-two, I am in graduate school and all I can say now is ""I'm not ready"". When I was a child, I wished and wished to be older. I fantasized about the day I could have my own house, my own car, my own life. My parents always told me ""Enjoy your youth while it lasts"". I had no idea what they meant. Now, I look back to my previous years and so wish that I could go back and appreciate them more. Now I sit with memories of a childhood uncherished. But I am trying to take that back. I'm not saying I won't grow up but there will always be that smaller version of myself who deserves to be a kid. Hopefully, in finding a pen pal, I can regain a sense of naivety that I once lost. Also, I really love the Tinkerbelle series so if I can't honor the small child in me through this, I will always have Tinkerbelle lolz.","[1&&moonbabe736&& Gemini to Gemini I think we could be very nice penpals. Maybe even real Pals(I have no friends) I also moved somewhere new when I started my adulting (I’m 21 rn) so I get it 100%. I also crochet, I like painting and have 2 dogs(Jim and Stewart). I’m also trying to get into ‘scrapbooking’ but the aesthetic collage kind cause I like the videos online. ]"

There were some limited release Harry Potter forever stamps. They are bit spendy, but I remember not too long ago the US booklet of them was about $20-30 for 20 stamps. Check both ebay and amazon. You can often find them a little cheaper on ebay. There is also a different set of 10 royal mail stamps on amazon for $20. I'd offer to send you what I have left of the US ones, (I don't feel too comfortable using them anymore with her views, but I can get behind this usage) but unfortunately I will not be where they are stored for at least several months. If you have a bit of time and an artistic bent there are also a few youtube videos with instructions to DIY a marauder's map. EDIT: There are also sets of Harry Potter wax seal sets. So you could send her a letter sealed with the Hogwarts crest, or a house crest. You can get one and some wax for about $9-12 it looks like. ]"

Hi! I consider myself an avid learner and a curious soul. I'm always eager to explore new ideas, cultures, and perspectives. You'll often find me engrossed in self helped books, trying out different hobbies, or engaging in deep conversations about anything and everything under the sun. One of my greatest passions is to enjoy and gain great memories in life . Whether it's hiking in nature, playing a musical instrument, experimenting in the kitchen, or delving into the world of art, I find joy in immersing myself in these activities and sharing the experience with like-minded individuals. I also appreciate humor and believe that laughter is the key to breaking the ice and creating lasting bonds. Aside from that, I'm always up for trying new things and stepping out of my comfort zone. If there's an adventure waiting to happen, count me in! As much as I love exploring the world, I'm equally interested in hearing about your experiences and passions. Listening and understanding others is just as essential to me as expressing myself. And, I'd love to know more of yourself too. Let's embark on this exciting journey of friendship together, supporting and encouraging each other along the way. Feel free to approach me anytime for a chat, just dm me and introduce yourself and where you from. You can also provide a selfie if you want to. Hope we click together and became friends. I'm thrilled to be a part of this wonderful community and eager to learn from each of you. Looking forward to getting to know all of you better! DM me!",[1&&jinx_newman64&& Messaged you! ]
